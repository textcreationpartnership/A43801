         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Here preſent thee with a Book, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſtiny or Calumny will drag out into the Public, whether I will, or no. The pretended Univerſity-man in his Remarks upon my Defence of the Fathers, having deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the humble Glory of traducing it, and me, in his Poſt-ſcript to Mr. <hi>Chiſwell,</hi> by ill Characters and falſe Hiſtories, has enforced this involuntary Publication. The Character he gives of it, is, that it is a Trifle, which he preſumes of it of his own Sagacity, without ever ſeeing it; that he is told by a good Hand, that it falls on Mr. <hi>Dod—ll's</hi> Principle with great Fury, and treats the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> very brutally; The Deſign herein is to preclude my Intereſt with the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> to whom he ſays I am relapſed. His hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Account is, that it was written, and ſent up to a Biſhop for Publication to divert a Storm expected on the Vindication <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by engaging my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and all the Biſhops againſt my Adverſary, that however finding the Trifle ſlighted, I earneſtly deſired that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb facs="tcp:102364:4"/>that it might not be printed, that ſo if I could get it again into my Hands, I might deny the Writing thereof to the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> as I begin to deny the other. The Intention of this is to repreſent me to all the Powers as an Apoſtate againſt the Government, Fool and Knave all over, that ſo I may have no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in it, but be abandoned by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>Before therefore I offer my own true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and Apology againſt this Slander, it is eaſily obſervable, that his Paſſion has marred his Art of Detraction in giving Marks of its apparent Falſhood. For what Clergy-man can preſume to put a ſervile Office on a Biſhop, or what Biſhop can be imagined ſo unreſenting as to admit it, or after Admiſſion to endure a Countermand from the vain Preſumer? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if it were rejected as a Trifle, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop cannot be ſuppoſed to promote its Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation without Diſgrace and Reproach, which none of them have reaſon to incur for any of their Clergy, eſpecially againſt the Senſe of the whole College Epiſcopal. And if ſo, then how could I earneſtly deſire the Biſhop that it might not be printed, when it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejected to me as a Trifle? He ſeems as vain alſo in hopong that that Biſhop, would keep it from me to refute my ſuppoſed deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thereof, as if a Trifle were worth a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's keeping, or, as if any Biſhop can be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt as to detain from any Man what has been for a while entruſted with him. I think this is rather an unhandſome and rude Uſage of
<pb facs="tcp:102364:4"/>that Prelate than of me, to whom I leave him to make ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, this Book was firſt written about <hi>Whitſuntide, Anno 93.</hi> before the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oral Diſcourſe of <hi>Warminſter</hi> it ſelf, and while the Heat of its firſt Conception (ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the Advices of Learned Friends) laſted, was deſigned then for the Preſs. But that Ardor being ſoon cooled, I deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view it, and procure a Friend by it (if I could) among the Fathers, not by its Publication, but by private Oblation. Accordingly after ſome Deliberation, I reſolved not to preſent it any Biſhop introduced into a deprived Dioceſe, leſt at the ſame time I ſhould ſeem to flatter, and abuſe him with a pretence of bringing ſuccour to their Cauſe, as if it needed any Advocateſhip, eſpecially ſuch as mine. For truly they that write honeſtly for a public Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, muſt not pretend a ſervice to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but the Benefit only of thoſe that are under it. So I reſolved to ſeek a Patron a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other unconcerned Biſhops, with whom I could hope my Principles would find favour, and ſo adventured it into the Hands of a Prelate, whoſe univerſal merits are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to his Character; by him it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to my own Right Reverend Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, and he by Letters from <hi>London</hi> acquaints me with his deſire of ſeeing it, and as my Duty was to obey herein, I ſent it him. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reading of it, he greatly inclined me to the Publication; yet withal forewarning me, that it would ſtir up Adverſaries, he would
<pb facs="tcp:102364:5"/>not preſs me againſt my own Judgment. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this intercourſe the other Book was in the Preſs, and almoſt finiſhed, and as yet my Dioceſan knew nothing of it. Whereupon I Wrote to his Lordſhip, that I was engaged for the Faith, for which I expected much trouble, and I knew not what would become of me; but his Lordſhip not knowing any thing more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the matter, ſuppoſed my fears (as he reputed them) cauſeleſs. Upon which I conceded to what his Lordſhip pleaſed to do, or have done. He thereupon puts it under the judgment of other learned Men, and it being by them well liked, deſigned (with ſome little variations offered me) that it ſhould be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the mean while the ſtorm purſued me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hopes or intermiſſion, and it was loudly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out that it was intended by the agreement of the Biſhops, that I ſhould be ſuſpended by my Biſhop, and Proſecuted upon the ruining Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, except I would prevent it by Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The good Offices of Friendſhip that were really done me among ſeveral of my Lords the Biſhops were concealed from me, and ſo I expected nothing elſe but an Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or ſuch a Perſecution for the Faith, as muſt have forced me from the preſent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Whereupon I had many cauſes to ſtop the Publication of this Book; for having but bad Eyes to engage in long Studies, and againſt many Adverſaries, and under ſuch proſpects of Expulſion cut of this Church, I thought it not only imprudent to draw on me more quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
<pb facs="tcp:102364:5"/>in the defenſe of a Communion from which I expected ejection, but ridiculous alſo, which I am reſolved no terrors, nor Perſecutions (by God's help) ſhall render me. But I muſt with Honour acknowledg, that all this Authors incentives have not been able to whet my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan (nor any others that I know of) to that Spirit of Perſecution which this Poſtſcript has aſcribed to him, ſo that I have no need of a Sanctuary among the Jacobites; tho' I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhall take occaſion to let this Author know, that ſuch as ſteer by their private Intereſt in their choice of Parties, and are as ready to change their Faith as their Allegiance, and diſpoſe Men by the ſame Arts to follow them in Eccleſiaſtical as well as Civil Turns, do make more Jacobites by their Prevarications, and thereby become more injurious to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Peace and Powers by far than any the moſt important and importunate Remonſtrants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government.</p>
                  <p>I have but one thing more to add in a Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Air and Structure of this Book. I hope there is no Man (no not the raging <hi>T. B.</hi> nor the more raging Poſtſcriber) will be able henceforth to call the Style Brutal. I preſs indeed the Arguments between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and their principal Authors with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Vigour, as without any Incivility, ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any partiality to either ſide, and this not only as a Diſputant but as a Caſuiſt, which ought to drive on all conſiderations home thro' and thro' the Conſcience. This Juſtice requires in a Dialogue between Parties, where not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:102364:6"/>the reaſons are to be ſtretched to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, but the Zeal of them alſo perſonated. In this <hi>T. B.</hi> pretended <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> to be defective and treacherous, which Accuſation, tho' falſe and cauſeleſs, yet has made me to carry on their Perſon here with much more Acrimony againſt their Opponents than otherwiſe I ſhould have done. This may indeed diſpleaſe the Learned Men concerned herein againſt them for ought I know, but to convert the divided I thought it expedient to ſhew my ſelf ſeverely equal and indifferent in ſpeaking for them in their own Spirit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than my own, and freely owning their Truths as well as ours. And if this does not ſatisfy the great Men, whoſe <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> are here neceſſarily diſmiſſed, I hope they will conſider however, that I have a Right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my own Principles in <hi>Solomon and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athar</hi> with as much ſtrength and ardour as they have aſſerted theirs. And they that have particularly and by name taxed that Pamphlet, who were never touched by me for any of their Writings before, muſt concede me a liberty to examin what they have ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it and it's Principle. It is an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Misfortune that two of the greateſt Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Nation ſhould herein run ſo widely to the Extremes, the one ſo far as to overthrow the Right of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the other to the proſtitution of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Hirarchical to Rapine and Violence, by laying Principles, which yet both of them think neceſſary to the Churches Preſervation.
<pb facs="tcp:102364:6"/>I have gone the middle way between theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Men, (who are indeed above all the praiſes, that I can give them) and ſince I find that a new Diſputation will be moved herein, I do moſt heartily beſeech thoſe two great Men calmly and candidly to treat of their Principles and their Conſequences in private firſt, and equally endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all Prejudices, and to quit whatſoever mistakes ſhall be joyntly diſcovered between them, and when that is done, ſhew ſuch an example of mutual Charity and Self-denial, as may render them (if poſſible) more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the World than they already are, that ſo we may haſten with all poſſible earneſtneſs to an happy Union, or at leaſt that the faireſt grounds may be laid for it. The Edition of this Book is indeed very uneaſie to me, but ſince neceſſity is laid upon me to publiſh it, and that as it was Written, I ſhall be glad, if it may prevent a reen-flamed Controverſie, which is threatned in Print by a Learned Jacobite, or may offer any ſuch notices as may contribute to their exacter conſiderations. But for my own part I reſolve never to appear in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie more, for as it may be eaſie for learned Men to refute and inform me, ſo I can bear inſtruction not only with eaſe, but with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude alſo. Whereupon I have nothing more to offer to all Authors of worth concerned, but that they will not think themſelves wronged till they have throughly diſcuſſed the matters between us impartially, and if after that I ſhall appear to ſeem to have done amiſs, I do
<pb facs="tcp:102364:7"/>hereby proleptically beg their forgiveneſs, and upon the diſcovery thereof will particularly retract it, and never run ſuch an hazard more God of his infinite mercy give us all a temper abſtracted from all partial intereſts and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and a ſincere Charity and Equity, that may fit us for a right understanding of the things that belong to our Peace, and Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God and Man. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>AS I gave you no provocation to ſuch unhandſome reflexions, with which you have beſpattered me, ſo 'tis the Opinion of wiſe and learned Men, that you are to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as incurably rude, and diſingenuous. And I truly am ſo far of their Opinion, that I ought not to anſwer you according to your Folly, leſt I become like unto you. But as little regard as is due to the Voice of the Slanderer, the Cauſe of Truth, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences offended by involved Prejudices, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a tender Deference and Care.</p>
                  <p>On which conſideration I have throughly traverſed all that ſeems pertinent in your Letters, and ſome M. S. Reflexions ſent me (I ſuppoſe) from ſome other Hand. And not only ſo; but I have examined ſome of the moſt exquiſite Diſcourſes and Principles of your greateſt Authors in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as well as thoſe of your greateſt Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; And I hope in all my Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, between you and them, I have done impartial Juſtice; if not, I have expoſed
<pb facs="tcp:102364:8"/>my ſelf unto public, juſt, and ſevere Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Of all your criminal Imputations there is but one that ſeems to deſerve any notice, <hi>viz.</hi> that which taxes me for giving the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogiſts in <hi>Solomon and Abiathar,</hi> thoſe tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Names and Characters. Upon which your Complaint being not only loud, but in ſome Degree ſpecious, does indeed oblige me to account herein. Nor ſhall I decline whatſoever is reaſonable. whereupon I ſincerely proteſt, that I took the Names from the known Senſe, each Party has of the others Temper. For the Conformiſts to the preſent State, thinking the Recuſants thereof too hard and untractable, I from that Notion, name my Recufant <hi>Dyſcheres;</hi> And the Recuſants thinking the others too eaſie and yielding, I from that Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on call my Conformiſt <hi>Eucheres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Eucheres</hi> has the Character of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt for conforming to the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and <hi>Dyſcheres</hi> of a Recuſant for refuſing this particular Conformity. And no Man of Senſe can really imagine, that I had any worſe Intention, ſince no Man can think that I would expoſe the Deprived as Fanatic's, and in the Perſon of <hi>Dyſcheres,</hi> I introduce them making a profeſſed Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of Popery in ſeveral Places, with which they are never charged by my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt.</p>
                  <p>And now if there be any Grains of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Human Tenderneſs left in you, can
<pb facs="tcp:102364:8"/>you imagine that you uſed a proper Method to heal, or ſettle my diſtreſſed and doubtful Spirit, who after ſeveral unanſwered Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written to ſome of the greateſt Doctors on both ſides of the Diviſion, and others of middle Temper, was at laſt upon their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect forced to turn a Publick Supplicant to the learned World for ſuccour and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? If this be the way of handling ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences, if this be the Oyl you pour into their Wounds, the good God have more Mercy on the Patient, and put him under gentler Hands.</p>
                  <p>But if you had judged me an improper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your Humanity, yet a due concern for the Reputation of your Cauſe ſhould have influenced you unto more Decency. For a good Cauſe needs no Supplies from a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger's Cart, and ill Language ever ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and diſcovers Defect of Reaſon as well as of good Nature, and never proſelites a calm and thinking Man, but rather ſeals up the Offended in their former Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and alienates mild Tempers from ſuch ſower Communion: When you have well conſidered the following Debate, you will have occaſion for ſecond Thoughts, to which in the Interim I leave you, and ſubſcribe,</p>

                           <hi>When I told you nothing but truth, that the Preſent State is worſe than a Deluge of Popery, for that now the Daughter of Sion is become an Harlot, the generailty of her Children, Apoſtate and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-churched, and that the Faith and Communion is with the few,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>You queſtion, Whether Submiſſion to the Preſent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. can be proved a Sin? As if breaking Lawful, and taking <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Oaths, withholding ones Right and giving it to another, the overthrowing the conſtitution of the Kingdom, and violating the Laws of God, were no Sin. Then you further ſay, That admit it to be a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin; every ſuch Sin, doth not unchurch ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Societies: But yet however, you ought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and not perſevere in your Sin; ſince it is one of thoſe Sins that ſhuts out of the true Chuch of God: For if it were neceſſary, I could prove, that its Principles deſtroy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102364:10"/>the Churches Fundamentals and Structure; if ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which deſtroy all Morals, and all Faith and Truth among men, can be ſaid to do ſo; by which men may exclude themſelves, as well as be thrown out by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without an Authentick Act of an Eccleſiaſtick Judic tory; and your inſtance in the Roman Church is Inſignificant, for we do not communicate with it; but that of the Eaſtern Churches is ſtill leſs to the purpoſe; for I am not ſatisfied, that either they have condemned us, or we them, as Schiſmaticks; and Dr.</hi> Baſier, <hi>was deſired by ſome of the Greek Clergy, to Communicate and Miniſter among them, neither did he refuſe it.</hi> T.

                        <p>But, Brother, it is not enough to call things by hard Names; but it is neceſſary to ſhew, wherein the iniquity conſiſts, and by what Law. For ſubmiſſion to a Civil Conſtitution after its ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no Perjury, Robbery, Rebellion nor Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, if men contribute no antecedent Evil to the Change; and it is this meer Submiſſion which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to defend, as being the only thing that can be charged on the Eccleſiaſtick Body. And tho you pretend it unneceſſary, yet you can never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry your cauſe, that we are Self Excommunicate upon the malignity of our Principles, except you prove it, and ſhew that our Maxims deſtroy all Morals, and all Faith and Truth among Men; ſince you load us with ſuch an heinous and general charge; and I know not to what purpoſe you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed me laſt, or diſcourſe me now, except it be to convince me of the Reality, and Anathematiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilt of our Sin in this Submiſſion. Here then you muſt to the Law, and to the Teſtimony, and make up a very exact proof in order to Conviction; for Men are not to be harangued into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by meer unproved and general clamour, but by very articulate evidence only, which therefore I ſhall expect from you in the courſe of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. In the mean time, when I alledged, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102364:11"/>we own the Roman and Greek Churches, to be Churches, notwithſtanding their far greater Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Confuſions than can be imagined in our preſent Eccleſiaſtical Change (that hence I might evince us not to be Unchurched; <hi>i. e.</hi> cut off from being Members of the Church Catholick, as not having been condemned out of it by any Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sentence) 'tis ſtrange you ſhould cenſure this inſtance for impertinent, upon theſe pretenſions, that we refuſe the Roman, but admit the Greek Communion: for by your favour, in order to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching (which very intelligibly is the making us no Church of Chriſt) you muſt have proved our Change more cenſurable, than all the Pollutions of the Roman and Greek Churches. And ſince you accuſe us as Self-Excommunicate, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of your Communion, which yet you deny not to the Greeks, as being with you no Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the inſtance of that Churches. Corruptions was not leſs, but far more pertinent to our Cauſe; for if their Corruptions are far greater than ours, and yet cut them not off from the Right of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion; I think we are as much entituled to that Communion, who have far leſs and fewer Irregularities: So that except you can prove our Change more Irregular than the State of the Greek Church, you cannot out us of that Communion you aſſert to them. Here indeed you ſaw your ſelf pinched, and ſo ſhift off the matter with a piff, as if I would be ſhaken off with an empty Scoff of Impertinence: No, no, I will ſit a little cloſer on your Skirts; and though I ſhall not exagitate, or upbraid all the known diſorders in that diſtreſſed Church; yet will I object to you the many Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Changes of their Patriarchs, made by a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Emperor, and admitted by them <hi>toties quoties,</hi> whenſoever the Grand Seignior has a mind to eaſe their Purſes of that money, which the new Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch is to tax on the Church as the price of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102364:11"/>without any other Provocation or Inducement whatſoever. Is not this a greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption than any can be imagined in our Change? This you know was what I intended, and yet you condemn not them as Schiſmaticks; though here are frequent Deprivations, and New Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments admitted by the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to the Will of an Infidel Prince, without any other crime of the Depoſed, and only for Monys ſake?</p>

                           <hi>In theſe alledged State-deprivations of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>High-Prieſts, either of</hi> Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar <hi>by</hi> Solomon, <hi>or after they came under</hi> Roman <hi>ſubjection, of the Chief Prieſts by the</hi> Roman <hi>Procurators, there was only a Change of Perſons, but matters of Religion went on every thing the ſame, in Doctrines, Practices, Prayers, Sacrifices and Services of the Temple, and the Synagogues; and when theſe are not corrupted, Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may yield their perſonal claims to State-Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſecure Protection, and Civil Benefits to the Church. This alſo clears the inſtance of the Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the</hi> Greeks <hi>on the frequent Deprivations of their Patriarchs by the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Governors. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Incorporation, which they propoſe to ſecure thereby, are not the moſt tempting, lying not ſo much in being priviledged and beneficed by the State, as in not being perſecuted, but tolerated under it. And their ſubmiſſion for keeping on this State-benefit, ſuch as it is, is not without detriment to the Church, (tho' their breaking with the State they fear would be more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102364:12"/>detrimental) the</hi> Turks <hi>making their new Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Mony to be levied on the Church by the new Patriarch, to the countenance and growth of great Corruption, and to the bringing of the Church in debt. But as to the courſe of Religious Miniſtrations, they are the ſame under both Patriarchs, in the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith and Manners, Prayers and Publick Offices.</hi> But now you know with us here is a change in all theſe parts of our Religion, in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to ſwear falſly, to rob our King, Biſhops and Prieſts, and to pray for Robbers and Uſurpers againſt the juſt and true Proprietors.</p>

                        <p>But all this Charge of Alteration in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is downright Calumny, uncapable of any proof in any one particular. For we preach only Submiſſion to a Legal Change of Governors, and pray for them that are ſet over us by Legal Rules of Conſtitution. Therefore tho' Governors, like the ſtate of all things temporal, are liable to changes, yet the Rules and Forms of our Religion and Morals are ſtill permanent and unaltered. And here, I think, I may ſeaſonably tell you, that the alteration of our Sovereigns was more legal than the change of the Theocracy to <hi>Chaldaean, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, Graecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Sovereigns; yet even for theſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were to offer Prayers and Sacrifices; and ſo is the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, to pray for the new Grand Seigniors brought into the Sovereignty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rebellious expulſion of the former, yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving in Bonds and Priſon, without any ſcruple of Allegiance to their new Maſter hereupon. Now if they ought to make an Eccleſiaſtical Oppoſition to ſuch an Imperial Change, then their ready confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereto, puts them into that ſame ſtate of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Religion, which you charge upon us; and how then are they in, and we out of Right to Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Communion? But to ſpeak truth, I could not have thought, that men of ſuch Primitive Rigour and Purity could Ligitimate that great corruption
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102364:12"/>in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which, tho' of it ſelf it doth not actually and totally Unchurch them, yet it is a moſt deplorable profanation of the ſupreameſt Order in their Hierarchy, and ſuch as a General Council, upon the perpetual Senſe and Principles of the Church Catholick, cannot but condemn for impious and irregular. But now I am under a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate concern for this Author, leſt this Principle of his bring him under that Hereſie, which your learned Vindicator of the deprived Biſhops, if he keeps up an impregnable impartiality againſt all Errors, will be apt to find in it. Sure I am here is laid a Rule for our Church to admit from the State even the moſt arbitrary removes and changes of Biſhops, for no cauſe at all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to humour the State in Tyranny, or Simony, according to Doct. <hi>Hody</hi>'s Doctrine: and here is conceded far more than was by the ſubſcription of a Popiſh Convocation for fear of a Premunire, and more than the Pope, or <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. ever arrogated to their Headſhip, or Supremacy; and to uſe your former words,<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. <hi>29.</hi>

                        <p>That the deprived Metropolitan and Fathers are a proper Court, or Council of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Judges upon all conforming Biſhops, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Laity of the Realm, I do utterly deny for many Reaſons. In the Province of <hi>York</hi> they have no juriſdiction; nor can they make a diſtinct Synod from the reſt of their Colleagues within the Province of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> So that had a Synod of meer Biſhops been called therein before any Biſhops made by King <hi>William,</hi> this had been a Synod, againſt which no Uncanonical Ordination or Enthronement could have been objected, and yet the Majority of theſe would have condemned their Recuſancy, if we may judge of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by their Conformity.</p>
                        <p>But further by our Conſtitution, the Body of the Clergy are concerned in our Synods; and which way think you would your Cauſe have gone in a full and Canonical Convocation? This your wife Author of Chriſtian Communion well ſaw, and therefore would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the iſſue<note n="*" place="margin">

But yet neither have theſe Fathers given a definitive Sentence of Exciſion upon us, which yet is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, where the actual Exciſion paſſes not meerly on the unconteſted notoriety and malignity of the Crime, which we ſuppoſe at preſent not to be our State. And let the Reaſons of their forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence be what they will, yet as long as we are not ſelf-condemned, but ſtand upon our Defence, we are not yet actually excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate by any effectual judgment of theſe Fathers: Nor can their practice amount to ſo much, either Legally, or intentionally. Time was, and yet is, I believe, when ſeveral of theſe Fathers would not cenſure our Submiſſion to the preſent Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as criminal and heinous. And one of thoſe Prelates in a publick Oration to his Clergy,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102364:13"/>ſtrictly charged them to abſtain from all oblique Reflections on each other, for refuſing, or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Oath of New Allegiance, but to retain Charitable Opinions each toward the other; which being a publick act of that Father's at the head of his Dioceſs, will not (I hope) be denyed as a Lye; nor may I be condemned for uncovering a ſecret, ſince this was not ſuch, nor tranſacted in a corner; nor need that Reverend Father be aſhamed or unwilling to own it; ſince it was a moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Indication of his Excellent Piety and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but withal a clear confutation of that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cenſure, which you place in their Practice. For the Practice of not Swearing, may in ſeveral Men have ſeveral cauſes; ſome may condemn the Allegiance; ſome may doubt only; ſome may have aſpects on another Revolution; others to the reproach of our, and to the eſteem of another Party; ſome to their former Writings or Pretenſions, points of honour, or the Fatigues of a Publick Station. So that except one unanimous Sentence againſt the Allegiance be judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially given, the argument from practice is very unconcluding: But beſides, the Practice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, will as much condemn them, as theirs can us, if this be of any ſuch importance toward a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Excommunication: So ſilly it is for Men to hunt after ſuch feeble Cavils, on purpoſe that they may ſeem to have ſomewhat to ſay, and not be born down by that Truth againſt which they have formed a Faction.</p>

                           <hi>that though our Church Juſtly and Abſolutely rejects the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102364:14"/>Roman Monarchy, yet ſhe will not refuſe any Lawful Communion, or correſpondence with it in any good Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Negotiations, conſiſtent with Integrity; ſaving ſtill a Publick Remonſtrance to all her Pollutions. What can be the meaning of this, but that your Church is ready and willing to joyn in Communion with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as many of your Brethren take the Oath, with a Declaration.— This, and no other can be your meaning, elſe your Argument and Parallel is ſenſleſs and inſignificant: for thus it follows, ſo ſhould you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with us in all that is Lawful: Now it is actual Communion in all publick Offices and Worſhip, which you require from us, and the reaſon you give, why we ſhould pay it, is in the words before cited, the ſence of which muſt be, that your Church is ready with a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance to afford the ſame Communion to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>that is, Actual Communion in Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> — <hi>So with an inſignificant Remonſtrance, you can go to Maſs, and are willing to do it.</hi> See this and a great deal more ſuch ſtuff in T.B's 2d.

This no doubt, would be a very pleaſant way of accordance with the Roman Forms; and yet at laſt, when I invited you to Communicate with us, in all that is Lawful, I meant only, what you think Lawful, what is by us both confeſſed Lawful, not to what we only think Lawful againſt your opinion; and to this end<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. <hi>3.</hi>

And further, by

Elſe, if you will not allow this Doctrine, you will be but mean Favourites in the French Court, whoſe new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts have all this form of Eſtabliſhment.

                        <p>Here is an hideous Out-cry, as if the whole Machine of the World were breaking into ruines. But yet methinks it ſhould be no hard task to ſtay the Convulſion. Firſt then, The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Competency is never to be proved, and 'tis almoſt, if not altogether mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe. For the prevailing part muſt be the major number in both Houſes, all which I ſuppoſe cannot be charged as parties to the Conſpiracy, or the Conſpirers. The Prince in his march did not paſs thro' above ten Counties, and touched but little of ſeveral of them, he ſaw not twenty Parliamentary Buroughs, nor ſent any Agents to concert with them; not many Peers joyned him till King <hi>James</hi> disbanded, and fled. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections in the <hi>North,</hi> tho' unoppoſed, were far from general, and the far greater part of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and all <hi>Wales</hi> ſaw nothing of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed nothing to that Commotion. How then can the Majority be all concluded into a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt King <hi>James</hi> before their Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thereby they ſhould become incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? Beſides, no man is to be taxed as a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, in order to forfeiture, or puniſhment, till judicially convict, or confeſſed. Otherwiſe, if he ſtands upon his innocency and Capacities, his Claim is to be admitted, and his Civil Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſecured, againſt which in our Convention no man found. Objection upon ſuch ſurmiſe, or imputation, which yet ought to have been made
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102364:17"/>by the Innocent againſt the Guilty to the eviction of their incompetency. Let us ſee then, whether the refuſal of his Letters, or Meſſage renders them Judges incompetent. Now this I think ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appertains to the Queſtion of actual Juſtice in their Proceedings than to their Competency, or Qualification for ſitting in Judgment. For a Judge duly authoriſed may act unjuſtly, and yet his judgment (till reverſed) ſhall be authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and effectual, which it could not have been, if the Judge had thereby become incompetent. But even in this, which, till well conſidered, ſeems the hardeſt caſe, it was neceſſary firſt to reſolve the Queſtion of Abdication before all others; which if carried in the Negative, then his Letters muſt in Law and Duty have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as from their preſent King; but till that point were determined, 'twas neceſſary to deny the Letters; for the Reception of them as from their then actual King had prejudged againſt all the Argument for Abdication, and had been a virtual Sentence, that he had not abdicated. And they could not well have reſumed that debate, without rejecting his Letters after reading, and cenſuring their own admiſſion of them, which would more juſtly have expoſed their Wiſdom, and offended you, than the meaſures which they obſerved. But after judgment paſt for the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication they could not admit his Letters under the Royal Style, becauſe they had judged, that he was not our then King; and ſo the Admiſſion of his Letters, as their Kings, had been a virtual Reverſe of that their Judgment in the ſame Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Breath; by which they had rendred themſelves, if not altogether incompetent, yet very injudicious Judges. And if after Judgment againſt his then Sovereignty they had ſent to him under the ſtyle and ſalutation of late King, and have made him King a-new, had it not been a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102364:18"/>wiſe Tranſaction, much to their Credit, Thanks, and the Nations Intereſt? So much then for the Conſpiracy. Next for the Authority, which you ſay was none, ſince no National Subjects of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Monarch can be his Judges.

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> falſly owns the fact you charge upon the Nation for the ſake of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which his ſpite to all Kings and Kingly Power, has caſt him into, <hi>viz.</hi> That the People may De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Kings as often as they judge them Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, which is almoſt as often as they pleaſe. But 'tis notorious, that the Eſtates judged the Throne made Vacant not by their Act of Abrogation, but the Kings own Abdication; which if ſo, all the world knows it muſt be in ſome degree Voluntary. Now here will I challenge Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> to ſay out; Does that claim of the then uncertain <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, make the Abdication manifeſtly falſe, ſince he ſays it makes the Diſertion ſo? Here I doubt his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage will fail him, leſt his Argument, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication follow the fate of the Paſtoral Letter. And yet it is manifeſt, that though K. <hi>James</hi> made many large and previous ſteps to the Subverting our Conſtitution, yet the Final Abdication of the whole Government, conſiſted in his Deſertion, from whence the Vacancy Commenced. and if this were no otherwiſe manifeſt, we have Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s own Averment, who tells us,<note n="*" place="margin">ibid page 29.</note> 
                           <hi>That we have an Act of Parliament, which declares the Realm</hi> of England <hi>to have been Sovereign during that time,</hi> (of Vacancy between K. <hi>James</hi>'s ſecond flight, and K. <hi>William</hi>'s Admiſſion) <hi>by ordering all Indictments, from the time of K.</hi> James'<hi>s withdrawing, till the</hi> 13th <hi>of</hi> February, <hi>to run in their Name.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, that meer Local Deſertion of the Land, of which there may be many Cauſes, does not <hi>ipſo facto</hi> extinguiſh the Sovereignty, except it be judicially interpretable to an Abdication from other concurrent Circumſtances and Indications, on want of which a demand of Return becomes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and the neglect thereof, interprets the Receſſion to an Abdication; but when there are evident tokens of yielding up a Government in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102364:20"/>form, manner, cauſes, and circumſtances of ſuch Local Deſertion, then a ſummons of Return is not neceſſary in point of Law, or National Duty, upon the antecedent forms of Virtual Abdication, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in ſuch Departure: If therefore his Act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in its own form, made a Legal and Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Abdication; his <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Letter imports no more, than that his words and actions are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, in quitting by deed, and claiming by word, the ſame Right at the ſame time. Upon this Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therefore the Throne becoming actually Vacant, was by the Act of the Nation, filled up with their Majeſties: And here upon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver powers K. <hi>James</hi> endeavours to Exert, as they do not reach us, nor ſend out their vertue by legal ways of courſe, ſo are they too late and out of ſeaſon; not to mention, that his late ways of Exertion under French Conduct, how honeſt ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you may call them, look not very natural or ſmiling upon Engliſh Men: If we ſum up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was ruining all the Laws and Liberties, with the Religion of the Lands he Ruled, and they were juſt on the Precipice under his Exertions; ſo that the Nation needed and gaſped for relief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: Upon this the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having Great Intereſts and Legal Expectations here, comes over with a declared Intention to ſet all things at Right, in ſuch order as the Engliſh Parliament ſhould adjuſt, which was a fair and moſt equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; this then was the time for K. <hi>James</hi> to have Exerted his Royal Power, &amp; Juſtice too, in calling a Parliament for ſuch purpoſes, according to the ſenſe of the whole Nation, earneſtly recommended to him by his Prelates, Nobles and Counſellors, for a long time, by ſundry Addreſſes, even to the laſt: and he having ſent out ſome writs thereunto, ſeemed a while enclined, but upon Romiſh Advice recalls that purpoſe, and inſtead of doing us that Juſtice, was reſolved to conteſt it with the Sword: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102364:20"/>his Army, which, had he called a Parliament to have healed the Nation, would have ſecured him againſt all Forreign and Domeſtick Violence, ſunk their Affections, as having no maw to Fight for him againſt their Native Country, Liberties and Religion, diſperſe by degrees, and great part go over to that which they knew to be the Juſter Cauſe; and he, being thus daily weakned, retires &amp; disbands the reſt; and even not then calling a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to help himſelf and us out of the Confuſion, he flies away to the Grand Enemy and Terrour of this Nation, and leaves us to ſhift for our ſelves under thoſe Aſpects and apprehenſions of dangers that lay before us: If then, he would not exert a Legal Power when he might, 'tis too late to offer at any Forreign ways of Exertion after a New Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement; or 'tis at leaſt unreaſonable, to demand our Reception of them to the deſtroying of our Redeemer after a National Allegiance given him, for his ſake, who ever purſued our general Ruine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws; his Oath, the ties of Natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the Sighs, Groans and Requeſts of his Loyal People. And whereas you ſay, we may have his Power and Preſence too, if we will, as lovely as that may be fancied, 'tis more than you can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For, if we were diſpoſed to accept your offers, if he ſhould come with a <hi>French</hi> force, are you ſecured, that the <hi>French</hi> would permit him to be as free and independent a Monarch as before? 'Tis poſſible they might erect him for a Vaſſal ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tularly Royal, till their ſtrength were fixed, and then upon demand of Expences, or other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, pick a quarrel with him to annihilate him for their Maſters Glory. Or ſuppoſing the <hi>French King,</hi> for once a true Friend to King <hi>James,</hi> would not his Forces make King <hi>James</hi> an Arbitrary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch here, to exert more than a legal Power over all the Bodies, and Souls, Eſtates, Coffers, and Purſes of the Nation? If we had had any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102364:21"/>maw for ſuch Power, we might eaſily have had it, while he was here, and not have been beholden to the <hi>French</hi> for the Commodity. But if King <hi>James</hi> ſhould concert privately with us to return without any <hi>French</hi> meaſures, or ſervices, can you aſſure us to keep this ſecret from the <hi>French</hi> King? Or if you fail in point of ſecrecy, are you ſure he will let King <hi>James</hi> go, or treat with us in neglect of his Intereſts, and Pleaſure? Or would he not rather <hi>Baſtile</hi> him for Ingratitude, and treat him hereupon after his uſual methods of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? Thus pretty are your Projects to expoſe the Fate and Fortunes of Nations upon, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a diſtemper in the Brain, as requires the Law of <hi>Bedlam</hi> rather than any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>

                        <p>When we deny the Authority by which your Eſtates ſate, you ask us <hi>by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was that Free Parliament called, or ſate, that voted in King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second? Sir, if you pleaſe, let another be called, and vote in King</hi> James <hi>the Second. When things are out of Order, and good men ſet them to Rights again, I do not think any man will oppoſe it upon the ſcore of ſome ſmall nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but when ſubjects rebel againſt their Prince, and drive him away, and make that the ground of their going on, and doing farther wickedneſs, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Authority of this. There is certainly in every man an innate natural Power and Authority to wiſh well to, and vote for Right. By virtue of this, when things were in confuſion, the Subjects of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second, returning to their Wits and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, ſend a convenient number to act for the whole, who recall their rightful King, and if you ſhould do ſo likewiſe, I ſhould not be very quarrelſom with you. But whatever name they might give it, to put a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gloſs upon the thing, they were no Parliament, till King</hi> Charles <hi>made them ſo; for he, their lawful King, by an Act in Legal Parliament, might ſtamp
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102364:21"/>on them that Character and give them that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Force, which they had not before; and thus ſeveral of their Acts might become Laws by virtue of that after Ratification, not by any force of their own. But as for calling back the King, that was not making any new Law, but enforcing the old, and was not ſo much an Act of Authority, as Obedience and Duty. And if you could find out the ſame way, you would be the beſt Friends to your Country, and your ſelves.</hi> T. B's 2d. Lett. p. 17, 18.</p>

                        <p>To anſwer according to the way and order you lead me, as I have before told you, we are now under no obligation to call in King <hi>James,</hi> ſo being under another ſettlement, things are not out of Order, and Unſettled, as they were upon the convening of that Free Parliament; and as there is no occaſion, ſo there is no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to attempt it. But whereas you charge the Subjects in general with Rebellion, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of their King, 'tis a broad ſlander and falſhood; for beſide the far greater numbers of the people that never moved, it ſeems that very few, that actually went over to the Prince, ever deſigned the expulſion of King <hi>James,</hi> but only the ſecure reduction of him and his exorbitant claims of omnipotent Prerogative to the juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Law and Reaſon by Parliamentary ways of Compoſure. Which, tho' they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, yet did they not expel him, but he went off himſelf, either for fear of Life, or obſtinacy againſt a Parliamentary Diſcuſſion, or becauſe of the fatigues of an unſuitable Government. But as to the Convention it ſelf, it rebelled not againſt him; for had he continued his Preſence, they would have deſired to meet by his Call, and then I believe not an Hair of his Head had fallen to the Ground, whatſoever his too conſcious fears and apprehenſions were, ſince the only Argument for the Vacancy of the Throne was founded in his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102364:22"/>Abdication, and that in his Departure from us, and leaving us in a ſtate of Anarchy; upon which it was not poſſible that they could rebel againſt him without his Preſence. As for your innate Authority to wiſh and vote for Right, I allow your meaning, tho' not the impropriety of your words; for an inward Right of wiſhing well is no proper Authority, which imports a Superiority over Inferiors, nor are private wiſhes formal votes in Civil Matters, in which an Authority to vote is not a natural Right of every man, but a poſitive Power of conſtituting Orders. And in Civil Negotiations all private wiſhes muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to publick Suffrages, and Determinations, And the Land ſent up that Free Parliament, not on their Natural Rights, but Civil Capacities of voting, and doing the beſt Right they could. And tho' they did well in bringing back the King <hi>de jure,</hi> having no other King <hi>de facto</hi> eſtabliſhed, nor any impediment to the Reduction of the Heir Lineal, yet if there had appeared to them any ſuch obſtacle, as would have rendred his Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction deſtructive to the Nation, and its Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Liberties and Conſtitutions, according to the Aſpects of our Caſe, they would have made ſome other proviſion for the time being, with which the Nation would then, and ought to have acquieſced, and ſo would a good Prince too; but there being no difficulty in that Juncture, they did their Duty in reſtoring the King. And as for the Name and Character of Parliament, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>de jure</hi> enſtamped on them, it matters not; for they were in that Juncture, and thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances a Legal and Authentick Council of the Land, tho' extraordinary; and whatſoever Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement they had made for the time being, had been valid from their Authority, as well as what they did had alſo authority both from their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Kings conſequent Ratifications; for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102364:22"/>ſingle Acts may have ſometimes plural Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Confirmations. But to convince you, that Conventions of Eſtates in ſuch Junctures and Confuſions are by themſelves authoritative to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle, I will diſcuſs it with you, and I pray an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me fairly.</p>

                        <p>You are no competent Judge upon them or us, what Right required them to do in their then exigencies; and if in truth they could not do what you would have had them, nor well and ſafely do otherwiſe than they did, then all this black Charge turns to a blanck, and comes to nothing. Now 'tis true, the Prince had no ſetled, or proper Juriſdiction, or legal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (ſtrictly taken) to enforce a Convention, or any thing upon it; nay, they had liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment of Abdication to have voted King <hi>James</hi>'s Revocation.

If they had not diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the refuſal might have opened a Scene of War between the Prince and the two Houſes.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102364:24"/>juſtly interpretable to an Abdication of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which was not <hi>Richard</hi>'s Caſe, which is therefore inſtanced altogether impertinently. Yet in that<note n="*" place="margin">See Sir <hi>Richard Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt.</note> very Caſe, whatſoever had been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures of the then Eſtates for the time being, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject people muſt have acquieſced in their judicial determinations, and preſumed them Legal till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in as Legal and Authentick Forms of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' <hi>Richard</hi> had lain for ever unredeemed; becauſe the multitude are uncapable of judging our National Laws, Rights and Capacities, and cannot act regularly to the recovery of Right, or performance of a National Duty: Yet it is bold in you to ſay, that my Vote would have paſſed againſt <hi>Richard</hi>'s reſtitution, ſince I, that have well known the motions and ſympathies of my own Soul thro' all this Revolution, ſhould certainly have been carried by my Bowels for that unfortunate King <hi>James</hi> againſt the wiſer and major part of that Aſſembly you traduce.

For tho' it is then only proper to require a King, or any perſon, to reſtore his Preſence, when he is abſent, when during his Abſence his preſence is needed; yet I never was ſo ſilly as to think Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Abſence competible, and conneceſſary at once, or that a Commiſſion in time of Abſence was improper to ſupply the deſect of perſonal Preſence, according to that ridiculous guiſe you clap upon my words; but my apparent palpable intention was, that it is prodigious peeviſhneſs to require a Kings Preſence or Commiſſion, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make the Seſſion of Eſtates Authentick,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102364:25"/>when he affords neither Preſence, nor Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for want of which all is left in ſupine and gaſping Anarchy, which were my expreſs words, on purpoſe ſet to obviate this, and other like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, tho' honeſtly omitted by you for inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, tho' therein lies the main force and form of my Argument, which is like to ſtand unmoved, notwithſtanding all the impotent flurts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly peeviſhneſs.</p>

                        <p>It confeſſedly ſeems, as I ſtated the Propoſition, you cannot deny the perſpicuity of its Truth, and therefore you invert it to an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Paraphraſe, which in many parts of it is not truly applicable to that which was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my Apology, <hi>viz.</hi> the Authority of the Convention. For all your aggravated Invitations,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102364:25"/>Combinations, Revolts, Treacheries, and Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictions, allowing, or ſuppoſing them to be no other than you deſcribe them, are not chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the whole Eſtates of the Land, eſpecially when in Convention. And even thus I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new my Poſition, That by the Laws of Nations, if a foreign Prince procure the Revolt of a vaſt part of another Princes Subjects, thro' the terror of which the helpleſs Prince leaves his Kingdoms in Anarchy under the Army of the foreign Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, who thereupon calls the Eſtates of ſuch, deſerted Nation to treat for a Settlement, they may convene, and treat with him upon ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation. For it is the neceſſity, the ſubject Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands in for a Settlement, that warrants and legitimates ſuch Treaties, by what means ſoever thoſe exigencies are introduced, whether by foreign Force, or inteſtine Commotions, joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſeverally, throwing all into Anarchy, and Diſorder. But if the charge of the Revolt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the legality of any mans Seſſion, that inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ought to have been objected, and if over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, proteſted againſt in Convention, as I have already told you; which not being done, they were all in Law, Reaſon, and Civil Conſtruction, lawful Agents, and Councellors. As to the word [Unreſiſted Power] I confeſs I uſed care indeed, but no trick; for it was too hard for me to judge whether the Prince's Power were irreſiſtible or no; and ſo it is in many caſes, in which Parties yield rather than run the hazard of a Battle. But every one can tell when it is, or is not actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; and the Propoſition is as true of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſted, as well as irreſiſtible Power. Tho' take you all the Forces foreign and domeſtick, joyned to the Prince when the Convention was called, you will think it hard for any Subjects to have reſiſted them, when the King himſelf long before durſt not, but disbanded, and quitted thereby all pretenſible Duties in the Subjects to take Arms.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102364:26"/>And the Conventioners deſerve to be your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants, for putting them upon ſuch an Eſſay. But if you will require, where the fault of this non-reſiſtance really lies, I think you may find it in him, that neither could be induced to call a Parliament, nor to fight it out. After which double miſcarriage, and flight out of the Kingdom, I think no man was obliged to reſiſt, or take up Arms, but to deſire ſuch a Settlement as the State of Affairs would admit. As for the Wars we maintain with our Purſes againſt all the Enemies of our preſent Settlement, they are juſt according to all the Rules and Forms of Civil Laws, to which you your ſelves contribute as well as we, only with more Crime, as doing that againſt your Conſciences, which we admit upon Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to us appearing good. But if you think your Exigencies legitimate, your payment of Taxes to prevent new danger, ſo we think the general Exigencies of the Nation did legitimate this Settlement, and do ſtill juſtifie our plenary Submiſſion thereunto, according to the Senſe, Laws, and Uſages of all Nations. As for thoſe you call Revolters, they were not the Subject of my Diſcourſe, whom I therefore leave to God, who, as he ſaw the provocations, ſo did he alſo every mans purpoſes, and trains of thought in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, according to which at the laſt day they ſhall each man be judged. But for thoſe that lay ſtill, I know no legal ſummons they had from King <hi>James</hi> to riſe in Arms, to make that quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a breach of Allegiance, in which certainly you <hi>Jacobites</hi> are as culpable as the others, and in one degree more, in that when you might, and upon your Principles ought to have taken Arms for him, you would not, and now when you neither can, nor ought, clamour for new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Commotions, by which we muſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably fall a prey to <hi>France,</hi> and a Burnt-Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to <hi>Rome.</hi>

                           <hi>the Churches Loyalty is to follow the Civil Judgment concerning the Object of our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the Tenure of Sovereignty.

                        <p>I am reſolved, that no calumnious uſage ſhall ſtorm or tranſport me into any indecent, or uncharitable paſſion. But tho', for my own part, I might reject your imputations of diſloyalty with ſcorn and ſilence; yet for your conviction I will calmly remind you, that I ever told you, that the Eſtates of this Land are not Judges of the Kings Perſon, who is not under their Power; nor in Law ſubject to them. And all that I any where ſaid of their Judgment about the Throne, amounts to no more than this, that in a ſtate of Anarchy on a King's Deſertion, or in Arbitration between two, or more Competitors, the Eſtates of this Land are the Supream Domeſtick Judges, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters upon the Tenure of the Sovereignty, and the Rights of the Nation in order to Settlement.

                           </note> that in extra-ordinary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and convulſions of State, our Laws, and Conſtitutions allow the Eſtates) ſuch a King, as can actually be had for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for which<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>5.</hi>
                           </note> I refer to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102364:27"/>our Hiſtories, Acts of Parliament, and Judgments of Law, under hereditary Kings, ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, without any Remonſtrance of King, Church or State to the contrary, and at laſt to Biſhop <hi>Overals</hi> Convocation Book. So that if a Queſtion ariſe in the diſordered Kingdom, who is my King, to whom my Allegiance is legally pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I refer to their Judgment as the then Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream in all our Civils; and if you can aſſign any Superior, or more Legal Judgment, to decide, and determine ſuch national Queſtions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, I am content to give up fairly to you. And if you can produce any Homilies, Articles, Canons or Monuments of this Church contrary to theſe my Poſitions, then I will yield, that the Churches Authority, as far as that can go upon Civil Queſtions, will lie againſt me. But a mans Eyes ſhall ſooner drop out of his Head, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any ſuch counter-principles in the publick conſtitutions of our Church, which you would have quoted, if you could, particularly, but ſince that could not be done, 'twas very feeble to make ſuch an hollow and cauſeleſs noiſe about it. And yet, if the Church in Civils had interpreted the Laws contrary to the Judgments of the State, ſhe had given a null and incompetent Judgment, ſince we are no Authentick Doctors in theſe matters, nor the Church a Court of Civil Judicature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions always juſtly lying on her, whenſoever ſhe admits the Pleas, and aſſumes the Judgment of Civil Cauſes. As to the Rebellion againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, it comes not near our Caſe, for there was a King actually Regnant, who in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament had redreſſed all their Grievances, and whoſe Tenure was indiſputable, and undiſputed, the very Rebels owning their Arms to be for King and Parliament. But neither was that Rebellion a judicial form of proceeding of both Houſes, (of which only I ſpake as Authentick in the Actual
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102364:28"/>Vacancy of the Throne, and a ſtate of Anarchy) but a military one, by a divided part of the Houſes, aſſuming the Style and Title of the whole Parliament, againſt a King actually Regnant, which I had no occaſion to mention, much leſs to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, the Nation having ſince condemned it by Act of Parliament. Nor had it been entred into by the unanimous Vote of both Houſes, had it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as a Law, as wanting the Royal Aſſent of the King then Regnant. And the Rights of the Crown, and Duties of our Allegiance are ſtill the ſame, tho' <hi>Milton</hi> will ſtill have Succeſſors to his Villanies ariſe, when their Sovereigns are invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to tamper with popular and ſeditious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and ambitions, in order to new projected commotions. But they who make the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have proceeded on principles of Rebellion contrary to their enacted Judgments, that hence they may draw Arguments to whiten the Old, and to enflame New Rebellions, deſerve they, and their incendiary Pamphlets to be burnt together. Nor need you fear any ſuch conſequence from any my Poſitions, as if upon theſe the Parliaments may change their Kings every Day, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Oaths; For I have aſſerted no Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Eſtates to be in Name, or Thing a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they mect contrary to the Fundamental Laws of their Conſtitution. And while a King is actually Regnant, they<note n="*" place="margin">The Triennial <hi>Act</hi> was not paſied when this was written.</note> yet meet, ſit, are proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, and diſſolved at the Kings Order only. And this being yet the form of our State, no Votes, or Bills of the Houſes can paſs into an Act, or Law without the Aſſent of the King Regnant, at whoſe pleaſure they immediately are, and are not, and ſo can make no Legal Aſſembly, or publick Change, without, or againſt him, over whoſe Perſon they are neither Lords, nor Judges. For
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102364:28"/>tho' Cauſes of the King may come before the Lords, and be overruled in Juſtice to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Right, againſt which they are brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet this is no more than what we ſee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts, which yet pretend no Sovereignty over the Kings Perſon, by whoſe Commiſſion they ſit in Judgment. So far am I from ſuch wicked Principles, as Plat-thorns in the Crowns of Kings, and ſet them in the moſt unſupportable Bondage, that Art, or Ill-nature can contrive, but withal provoke great ſpirited and deſigning Princes to ſeek avenues to an Arbitrary Power, who would have gladly been contented with a regular and equal Sovereignty, if they could have been ſecured in it from the fears, and incentives of popular inſolence. But to return from this Digreſſion, if a King thro' any fear, or cauſe whatſoever, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſerts his Kingdoms, and leaves all in Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and Confuſion, that the Eſtates of the Land, if they can, ſhould then Convene, and ſettle the Nation the beſt way they can, is ſo far from Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, that it is moſt certainly both their Priviledge, and their Duty And if they are firſt to determin our Settlement, I am ſure the Churches Loyalty is to follow their Judgment, except we challenge an Appeal from them to the Church, to ratifie, or vacate our Civil Conſtitutions. And if you call this Duty of Submiſſion to their Civil Settlements im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith in the Parliament, it will be prone to retort, that you challenge an implicit Faith in the Church, and that in matters not Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, in a latitude more Exorbitant than any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Truth is, our Duty to any ſuch eſtabliſhed Settlements is not founded in an implicit Faith, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects <hi>are things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. but in an apparent, explicit, and authentick Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as all other Duties purſuant to Laws and Publick Judgments are, and no otherwiſe. And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102364:29"/>you that will allow the Churches Loyalty, as to the Object, to be guided by the true Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the State, but not by every Civil Judgment, have need to explain your ſelf, what ſhall he the Supream Civil Judgment for you concerning the Laws and Conſtitutions of our State in rare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual and dangerous Caſes of Deſertion, and Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. For if you aſſert to every man a practical Judgment upon our Laws and Rights in ſuch Caſes, and that even againſt a National Judgment, the Confuſions muſt be eternal; If there muſt be a Civil Council, I pray aſſign me any other like that of the Eſtates in Convention, who indeed, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as ſuch Caſes call upon them, are the Supream Judges of the Conſtitutions and Rights of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Arbiters of our Settlement concluded thereupon. And if you will not yield to every ſuch Civil Judgment, you may as well ſay, you will yield to none, excepe it comports with your private Humours, or Perſuaſions, which is the true and plain Engliſh of your Anſwer herein, if I may uſe the freedom you take with me, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Paraphraſt, or Interpreter, and is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Expedient to ſettle us by eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable diſcords in Opinion and Practice.</p>

Did ever any Body hear of ſuch a Conſtitution as this? Or was any thing better fitted to produce eternal Confuſions? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you have a mind to perſuade us, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions were made by the Wiſe Men of</hi> Goatham, <hi>or the Wiſer Men of</hi> Bedlam. T.

                        <p>You frequently uſe a ſuſpicious Artifice of traveſteering, what cannot be plainly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, into farce and miſhapen figures, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it in Ridicule. By which however you call upon you the Sentence of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, What ſhall be done unto thee thou falſe Tongue? Mighty and ſharp Arrows, with hot burning Coals.</hi> For if I may be my own Paraphraſt, my Senſe is, that all Eſtates and Subjects are to their utmoſt obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve together the Sovereign and the Sovereignty, and the eſtabliſhed forms of Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preciſe conſtitution of the Laws; but if theſe be irreſiſtibly overborn, or the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign abdicates all to Anarchy, then it is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Eſtates to ſettle under ſuch Sovereigns, as can be actually had for the time being, till the old Rules can be fairly recovered; which being poſitive, muſt give place to a temporal neceſſity. But did I ever ſay that Tyrants or Traytors, getting into Poſſeſſion by meer Force, had Right, and Law on their ſide? No ſure; for they may break all Law, Right, and antecedent Rules of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and yet the oppreſſed Eſtates may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully admit the Oppreſſive Power, when it appears

More integrity was due and becoming ſuch ſtarched or ſacred pretenſions. But I have well learned, that Faction leavens the Soul, not only with ſowerneſs, but with inſincerity alſo. But as I truly ſtated, and have now explained the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Duties of our Conſtitution, I aſſert it a Fundamental Law to all Civil Societies, except perhaps that pair of diſſyllable Seigniories, which you mention, where the Politcks, Logicks, and Ethicks ſuit with your, and where, unleſs you'll to the <hi>Antyceryae,</hi> I muſt leave you. And ſince all Kingdoms, and Empires are by the juſt and adorable Counſels of Gods Providence ſubject to ſuch various Turns of Fate, all Princes, that take Crowns upon them, take them with the Laws of their fortune, and a conceſſion to the regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch Change, under which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the innocent Subjects under new ſubmiſſions,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102364:30"/>tho' they condemn, and (being reduced) proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted all thoſe that enforced the Change. But as long as the Duties of Subjection are ſuch as I have deſcribed, inteſtine changes and diſorders cannot ariſe from them. And while Princes miniſter Juſtice and Judgment to their People, and make their Proſperity the Royal Care, they are ſeldom threatned with Commotions. But yet it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, that for unſearchable, tho' Juſt Reaſons, the Judgment of God permits the moſt innocent Princes to inteſtine as well as foreign troubles, which yet however they that promote, ſhall not eſcape Divine Vengeance. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the determination of ſuch Wars, it can be no ſin to acquieſce under thoſe forms of Settlement, which our Eſtates can procure for the time being, tho' different from the ordinary Courſe. And there is no other Rule to recover the Civil Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nations but by theſe Principles, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Princely Spirit muſt be preſumed to allow, in equity and compaſſion to all his good Subjects, to reſcue them from utter extirpation, or perpetual miſery.</p>

And yet however had it been otherwiſe, by parity of Reaſon all our Acts obliged the Subject now during this preſent Reign, and we are thereby acquitted in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubmiſſion, whatſoever nullities it may fall under in your next Revolution. But there is a Famous Act, <hi>viz.</hi> the 11th of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth Chap. 1. made in an Extra-lineal Reign, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it for Law and Equity, that Subjects pay their Allegiance to the King for the time being, and indemnifies them herein againſt after puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This Law was never ſince confirmed, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured or repealed by any ſucceeding Prince, or Parliament, and yet ſtands firm in the Body of our Statutes to all Civil Effects and Judgments, which paſs ever ſince according to the importance and tenour thereof.

But I know who has taught me to give place unto wrath, while I encounter your Reaſons. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Is it not a Queſtion profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe, whether all Men did ever think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to approve Extra-lineal interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? For did you ever know all men in the ſame Opinion, that they ought to approve any one State of things? But this is not your only Lapſe of Senſe. It is not the Interruptions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of State that I would have you approve, for no good man can approve Interruptions in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Government, as ſuch. But I require you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubmit to ſuch National Settlements as cloſe up our Confuſions, and ſo far only to approve them, as they are Ends of Strife and War, it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102364:34"/>there appear no other Good in them. As wiſe alſo is your ſecond Queſtion, Did they not ſtill, as opportunity ſerved, aſſiſt Right? I pray, who are theſe They, but your All men juſt before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the Antecedent to this Relative? But did all men, as opportunity ſerved, aſſiſt Right? How then came there any to be in the Wrong? Or how came all men together to want an opportunity to do Right? Or how came there in any Diſorders, and ſuch a general Expence of Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to very ill purpoſes? But what think you of thoſe, that enforced theſe fatal Expences? Were they of the All men, or no? Or did they act aright in breaking down the Settlements of the Nation, in order to what you call Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Right? For my part I would not vindicate an Inheritance by the ſlaughters of poor harmleſs people in the proſtration of their Civil Settlement, to gain the moſt abſolute Empire in the whole World; For I think no one mans mear perſonal intereſt in any external priviledge is worth one innocent mans life, whatſoever your, or other Martial Opinions may be in theſe Matters. But if you juſtifie thoſe Sanguinary Commotions, and Barbarities againſt the Publick Settlements here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore for the reduction of the Heirs Lineal, and can tell us, that we can have no Peace in our preſent State, I hope henceforth your Party will not ſay, that I enrage the preſent Powers againſt them, ſince you openly proclaim an irreconcilable War againſt the Eſtabliſhed Conſtitution, and blow the Trumpet for your own deſtruction, if the Government were not gentle, and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to your very Ravings. But whereas you charge us for having conjured up Confuſions, and pleading for the continuance of them, I ſhall reply, that all the Evil, that hath been done againſt our Conſtitutions, from the time that <hi>King James</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vacate our Laws, and to embroil us in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102364:34"/>diſcords, in order to an Arbitrary and Popiſh Government, until the day of the new Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under their preſent Majeſties, contributed to our Confuſions, and every Party to thoſe Evils, of what Character ſoever, muſt account to God for it, who will admit no Plea for thoſe Evil Actions, or Confuſions. But on the Day, in which the Prince became King, our Confuſions ended in an orderly, peaceable, and (were it not for your unquietneſs) an entirely happy Settlement, for the continuance of which we plead againſt thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Confuſions, to which your bitterneſs would reduce us. And now (as ill luck would have it) we are fallen in on Biſhop <hi>Overal</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, who can have no eaſe neither, becauſe of our Confuſions. But now, I pray, what have I ſaid of that Monument they have left behind them? No more than this; <hi>And Biſhop</hi> Overal<hi>'s Convocation Book comes up to it.</hi> To what? Why to this, that a full Settlement under Extra-lineal Kings muſt be ſubmitted to both by the Clergy and the People. And doth it not come up full to this in their Firſt Book and 28th Chapter and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non? Where it aſſigns this Obedience to the full Settlement even of ambitious Princes, and Rebels, procuring that thro' Settlement by wicked means. And in the 27th Canon of the ſame Book it is reſolved, <hi>If any man therefore ſhall affirm; — that any perſon, born a Subject, and affirming by all the Arguments, that Wit or Learning could deviſe, that God had called him to murther the King</hi> do facto, <hi>under which he lived, yea, tho' he ſhould have firſt, procured himſelf to be proclaimed, or anointed King, as</hi> Adonijah <hi>did,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>he doth greatly err.</hi> Now a King <hi>de facto</hi> with this Synod is one that is in by full and legal Forms of Settlement, as by Submiſſion or Continuance, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 30, tho' attaining thereto by unjuſt means.

                           <hi>At laſt you very gravely give us your Opinion, that in the late Oath of Allegiance the word [Succeſſors] was added after [Heirs] on this very ſelf ſame Ground, that tho' Heirs by the Ordinary Courſe are the Legal Succeſſors, yet others legally may ſucceed in Caſes extra-ordinary. This it is for men to give their Opinions without Book, and without any other conſideration than to pervert the State of the Caſe. Had you given your ſelf the ſmall Trouble to read over the Oath, you could not for ſhame have put this interpretation upon it, for the expreſs words of it are [Lawful Succeſſors] which follow the word [Heirs] by way of Limitation, or Reſtraint, to ſhew that none ſhall ſucceed but the Legal Heir. And thus, Sir, the words of the Oath, inſtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, plainly and peremptorily exclude your extra-ordinary Succeſſors, and extra-lineal Kings. Thus your new invention hath added a freſh abſurdity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a remedy to thoſe many others, which your Party run into upon Diſcourſes of this Matter. And tho' you mince the matter, yet you might have been ſo bold to ſay, the Oath requires Allegiance to unlawful Succeſſors, as what you have ſaid; for while there is one in being, and claiming, to whom the Right really belongs, what can your extra-ordinary Succeſſors be but Tyrants, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers?</hi> T.

                        <p>This, I confeſs, is an amazing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, if my Memory hath in truth beguiled me. And 'tis a challenge enough to ſhock a greater confidence than mine. To prove this therefore we muſt recur to the Form Enacted by the Statute, Anno Tertio Jacobi Regis, &amp;c. <hi>Alſo I do ſwear from my heart, that notwithſtanding any Sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or Deprivation, made, or granted, or to be made, or granted by the Pope, or his Succeſſors, or by any Authority derived, or pretended to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, or his See, againſt the ſaid King, his Heirs, or Succeſſors, or any abſolution of the ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their obedience, I will bear Faith, and true. Allegiance to his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, and him and them will defend to the utmoſt of my Power, againſt all attempts whatſoever, that ſhall be made againſt his, or their Perſons, their Crown, and Dignity, by Reaſon, and Colour of any ſuch Sentence, or Declaration, or otherwiſe; and will do my beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to diſcloſe and make known unto his Majeſty, his Heirs, and Succeſſors, all Treaſons and Traiterous Conſpiracies which I ſhall know, or hear of to be againſt him, or any of them.</hi> Theſe are all the times the words Heirs, and Succeſſors are mentioned in the Oath, and in theſe here is no Character of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſet at all. So that here you fall under the ſame fault you charge upon me, of not reading the Oath, and another added in a bold interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereof at all adventure; or if you have read it, 'tis the greateſt of all prevarications con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſly to miſrender it; but whether it were the one, or the other, it is the moſt frontleſs, and unparallel'd impudence to down-face an obvious Truth with notorious Falſhood. And yet have a little patience to ſee what you had gained by this remark, if it had been true. You had ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. <hi>3.</hi>

                           <hi>That the Oath of Allegiance binds to the King, his Heirs and [Lawful] Succeſſors;</hi> and I taking it<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102364:36"/>for granted, that you interjected the word [law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful], not as a part, but an interpretation of the Oath, denied it not, but without any cavil candidly admitted it; but becauſe I formed an Inference from that Oath, that you like not, you interpolate the Text of the Oath by foiſting in the word [lawful], that hence you might draw a pretence, that Lawful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors limitedly denote the Lineal Heirs. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would this have held; For had the word [lawful] been found in the Oath, my Argument had ſtill been good,<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. <hi>5.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>That in the late Oath of Allegiance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words [Heirs] the words [Lawful Succeſſors] were added on this very ſelf ſame ground, that tho' Heirs by the ordinary Courſe are the Legal Succeſſors, yet others legally may ſucceed in Caſes extraordinary.</hi> Nay this legality of ſuch extra-lineals had been more fully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, had the word [Lawful] been inſerted, than now it is. For now if a man would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and were there no other Reaſon upon other Bottoms, he might argue, that this Oath ſimply ſetting all Succeſſors, without any expreſs Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Lawful to exclude unlawful, requires Allegiance to all Actual Succeſſors indiſcriminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any reſerved reſpect to any legality, or illegality. But whether we ſuppoſe the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Lawful as intended by the Senſe, or no, the addition of [Succeſſors] after [Heirs] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, that their may be Succeſſors, to whom our Allegiance is by Oath ſecured, that are not Heirs in the ſtrict ſenſe of Lineal Deſcent; or elſe after [Heirs] no word of that Importance ought to have been added. But as I was at firſt candid in the Conceſſion of the Legality, ſo will I here give you the reaſon of that Candor. Having then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that all Duties reſpect Laws, and that what is not Legal, can have no Legal Obligation,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102364:36"/>and withal that the Oath obliges to the Succeſſors of the very ſame Legal Sovereignty eſtabliſhed here, it appeared to me, that he that comes into any other form of Sovereignty over us, hath no right to our Allegiance by virtue of that Oath, or the old ſtanding Laws, whatſoever Title thereto he may acquire by virtue of New Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. But if he aſſumes a Sovereignty that is in no wiſe Legal, 'tis Tyranny in Form and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and while it is barely ſuch, the man is an Enemy, and no Allegiance can be due to him. Now the Legal Forms, by which Extra lineal Kings are inveſted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sovereignty, ſtand in Admiſſion and Recognition of our Eſtates, when inſuparable Exigencies, or juſt Cauſes inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate the Heirs Lineal to reign over us, or us to be reigned over by them; of which Obſtacles in a ſtate of Anarchy the Eſtates are our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt and Final Judges.</p>

                        <p>Truly, Brother, this looks rather like whining under an Argument, than an Anſwer to it; for men ſeldom make a moan under any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection they can ſolve. Yet is your Reflecters Complaint herein as little ſincere, as manly. For I ſaid not that our Oath to <hi>King James</hi> alone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges our Allegiance to <hi>King William,</hi> as you from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102364:37"/>him repreſent me, but that<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. 4. to p. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>putting all together, that I had ſaid, my concluding Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, that our Old oath of Allegiance (ſuppoſing it ſtill in force) to the King, his Heirs, and Succeſſors, binds us to pay Allegiance to</hi> King William <hi>and</hi> Queen Mary, <hi>as the preſent actual recognized Succeſſors to</hi> King James <hi>upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction (though not of his Life, yet) of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.</hi> And this you can never diſprove, except you either ſhew, that in that Oath the word [Succeſſors] ſo diſtinctly ſet after [Heirs] three times in the ſame Paragraph, was purpoſely ſet to exclude all Extra-lineal Kings for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby all the Statutes, and former ties of Allegiance actually owned under the paſt Extra-lineals will be repealed by this Enacted Oath, and all Judgments ever ſince paſt accordingly vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or elſe that <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary</hi> are not actual Succeſſors to <hi>King James</hi> in this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, by the ſame, or as legal forms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as other Extra-lineals were before them, by a National Admiſſion and Recognition; tho' ſomewhat more than Extralineal Forms may be challenged to <hi>Queen Mary</hi> upon her Fathers Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. Now when you, or your Prompters perform either of theſe Exploits, then uſe your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective Powers even unto hoarſneſs; but till then 'twill not be prudent at the ſame time to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, rude, and inſincere too.

                           <hi>And even an unjuſt Potentate, tho' he cannot according to Legal Juſtice out a King, againſt whom he hath no Legal Cauſe, or Right of War, yet if he doth ſo, and the ſubject People cannot help it, and he enforce himſelf upon the People for a new King, our Laws in this concur with the Laws and Practices of all Nations, in allowing our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102364:38"/>Eſtates to determin for us in ſuch Exigences, as is manifeſt in the long Contentions, and many Turns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Houſes of</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Lancaſter; <hi>and the ſin ſhall lie only on the injurious, and not them that ſubmitted to an inevitable fate of things.</hi> And again,<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Wars and Victories are many times unjuſt, yet they, that ſuffer the injury, lawfully ſubmit to the unlawful and injurious demand of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> So that taking Right for a Title found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in real Juſtice, no man really can have Right in the ſight of God by a meer unjuſt Act, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. And yet, tho' the preparations to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire new Kingdoms or Dominions be unjuſt, if that very conſtituent Act, which transfers the Poſſeſſion, does at the ſame time infringe no mans preſent and permanent Right, ſuch poſſeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Rightful. But all this is nothing to the purpoſe. For our Queſtion is only of who, or what is formally legal, not what is in real hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty morally Rightful. For all Poſſeſſion, which a man obtains by legal forms of Proceſs, either in War, or Peace, is formally and apparently Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to all Civil Purpoſes and Conſtitutions, tho' the Cauſe obtaining be far from being really and morally right. And a man by legal Judgment may <hi>de facto</hi> be put into poſſeſſion of what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man hath a real Right to, ſo that the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor ſhall have the Legal Form of Title in what is really anothers Due. And in all ſuch Caſes all Affairs belonging to ſuch Eſtate follow the Legal Tenure of the Poſſeſſor, who is therefore in Law taken as <hi>bonae fidei poſſeſſor.</hi> And even antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to Judgement quiet poſſeſſion in a private Eſtate, tho' ſlipt into by cunning Frauds and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, againſt which there is no Civil Law, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Law for formally Legal, till the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant loſes it, either by Art, or Judgment. Now all independent Perſons, and Princes, that are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102364:39"/>ſubject to no Judicial Tribunal, contend by War, not Law, and what they ſettle themſelves in by the forms conſequent upon War, they have ſuch a formal Title to as the Laws of War and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions yield them, and no other; tho' whether Cauſe is juſt, and conſequently thereupon whoſe Poſſeſſion is honeſtly rightful, none can effectually judge but God amidſt ſo many pretenſions. And in ſuch Turns the Subject People muſt, or may lawfully yield to the formal Titles, or Fates of War, ſince they are not authoritative Judges on the Cauſes, or Rights of the Quarrel, of which mens private Opinions are moſt times very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but can hardly ever be ſure, or unanimous. And by this Rule all Nations go, and there is no better; tho' God forbid, that any man ſhould be obliged to think all the Spoils of War and Law to be really honeſt, and morally rightful. Now according to theſe Rules and Diſtinctions I aſſerted that Extra-lineal Kings may be Lawful Succeſſors in Caſes Extra-ordinary; and I will add, upon Cauſes really Juſt, Rightful Succeſſors too. And leſt you ſhould quarrel at this Diſtinction, as of private Invention, but no publick Character, I refer you to the late Oath of Allegiance in the firſt Paragraph, where our late Sovereign Lord <hi>K. J.</hi> is declared Lawful and Rightful King of this Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he might be taken for not only <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de jure,</hi> King. But amidſt all this Duſt, of what uſe is a General Queſtion or Poſition, except it properly affects our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes? So that in order to the Cenſure you deſign upon <hi>King William,</hi> you ought to have charged all the Facts in your ſtated Queſtion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon him in the Courſe of the Revolution, with exact congruity and accuracy; that you might have evinced his Illegality, or Incapacity of Right in the Poſſeſſion of this Crown. But this you perhaps fancy every body can do. But I will
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102364:39"/>in truth try, whether it can be done, or no. I allow you then in the foundation, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at his Deſcent, as he had no Right, ſo he pretended none to this Crown, and declared his Intentions not to injure <hi>King James</hi> in any his Perſonal, or Royal Rights whatſoever; but then I deny that the Prince ſeized the Crown by ill Arts, or any breach of publick Proteſtations. For when he came in the Head of an armed Force, he declared, that he came not for the Crown, but a Deciſion of his Cauſe in Parliament, to which end he ſent the King fair Articles of Truce and Treaty during the Seſſion. But the King refuſes, or neglects the Propoſals, and leaves the Kingdom in Anarchy. Now all ſuch Declarations in War have this natural, obvious, and perpetual inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if the matters in Controverſie be adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as demanded, the Prince demandant will be fully ſatisfied, as having no deſign to ſeize his Adverſaries Dominions, if he will right the Cauſes of Hoſtility in the manner claimed; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the very form, and Face of War, and Arms is in Fact an open Declaration to vanquiſh, out, dethrone, and cruſh the Adverſary by all Martial and Hoſtile Methods whatſoever. So that <hi>King James</hi> nglecting his Demands in not calling a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to ſatisfie the Prince, cannot complain, that he has broken his Faith, or Declaration in taking his Crown. And further, when the King was gone, there appeared no Force, or Fraud in the Prince's Actions with the Convention, to whoſe Judgment he fairly left the whole Cauſe and State of Affairs; and they, having maturely and peaceably debated all things, judge <hi>King James</hi>'s Deſertion, with reſpect to all antecedent paſſages, to be an Abdication of the Government; and withal they judge the Prince's Succours to have merited the Crown, which, with the amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conceſſion of the two next Heirs, they cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102364:40"/>offer up to him, which he then accepted, when a fair Capacity and title was thus legally opened to him. So that tho' at firſt he had no form of Title, Pretentions, or Deſigns for this Crown during <hi>King James</hi> his Right, yet when this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and no other Legal Obſtacles interpoſed, there was a fair Reaſon to accept that then, which it was not lawful in Conſcience for him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to covet, or deſign.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102364:40"/>For it was not meer obſcurity of the Deſcent, tho' much involved before the common World by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Pretenſions, that warranted the People in theſe Submiſſions, but the neceſſity of ending Spoils, Rapines and effuſions of Blood. For if the compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor Houſes would have acquieſced in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eſtates, they could well have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for the better title upon a fair Heraldry, or production of Deſcents. But the Families, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities offered themſelves, were generally reſtleſs under the Superiour Houſe; but thoſe ſtirs were legally ended <hi>toties quoties</hi> by Parliamentary Recognitions. But the final end was not procured by the clearneſs of an undoubted Title, but by the Marriage of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. with the Lineal Heireſs of the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> by which all competitions cloſed; but <hi>Henry</hi> ſtood upon his own bottom in the National Recognition through all his Reign, and neither yielded ſubjection to, nor derived his Title from his Queen. But yet let us ſee in dubitable caſes how great your allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be, and particularly in the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Reigns? Suppoſing then the Title between the two Houſes dubitable, or doubted only with one part of the Nation, but certain to the reſt, ſhall both theſe Parts ſwear one Allegiance to the Title, which is doubted by one Part, againſt that Title which the other Part is certain of? If ſo, then you allow one Part of the Nation to ſwear againſt a Title, which they know to be certainly Right; Or muſt the doubting Part concede to the Title, which others know to be Right? If ſo, then the <hi>Lancaſtrian Line</hi> cannot be admitted, or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any your allowances. Or muſt there, in this Caſe, be two Kings for the two Parties, and two Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiances in this one Realm? Or what if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, and Doubts multiply, where ſhall theſe, and their Diviſions end? But ſuppoſe the whole Nation to doubt of the Lineal Right, will you
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102364:41"/>require them to ſwear Allegiance to a doubted Title? If not, then what allowances do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede under theſe doubted <hi>Lancaſtrian Reigns?</hi> Or what Judgment paſs you on the Allegiance then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways given? For ſo there muſt have been none ſworn at all. But if you will require a Nation to ſwear to a doubted Title, does that Oath import an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of Right, or no? If it does, then you will require a Nation to affirm that upon Oath, of which confeſſedly they are not certain, and that is one degree of Perjury. If ſuch Oath does not (implicitly at leaſt) aſſert Right, then it is no acknowledgment of Right, nor founded on the preſumption of it, which yet however you all contend for, to render our preſent Allegiance in this point perjurious. But it is hardly poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppoſe a whole Nation in doubt, when there are Competitions; For the Competitors, and their Complices, or Parties uſe abſolutely to aſſert their Right without any doubt, or pretence of doubting, and then they that doubt, tho' the generality, muſt either ſuſpend, or go over up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uncertain Truſt, whereby they may exclude the Right unawares. But if you will make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances in doubtful Caſes, then what think you of the Queſtions ariſing upon <hi>King James</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion? Did they afford any poſſible occaſion, or ground for diſputation, and ſcrutiny? If ſo, then it miniſtred doubts to be diſcuſſed, and the Caſe was dubitable; But 'tis a vanity for you to ſay, that it gave no poſſibility of diſputation, for they that diſputed it thought otherwiſe, and between their and your Opinions doubts muſt ariſe herein among the multitude, to whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your great allowances are to be made in their preſent Allegiance. But to deal plainly with you, I think no Man, or Nation is to ſwear upon what is to them dubitable, as what is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly rightful may be; but what is viſibly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102364:41"/>and judicially Legal cannot be, as coming home to the Senſes of the Subject by publick ways of notice, and operation; and therefore all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and perſonal doubts muſt herein concede to ſuch judicial Determinations, to put an End to all thoſe Miſeries, with which you unjuſtly charge us, and maliciouſly threaten us.</p>

                        <p>I thought, when you and I began Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences on this Subject, we ſhould have only talked of Caſuiſtical Points in order to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and conduct of our Conſciences, and not have deviated into ſuch an Unchriſtian and Seditious Railings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it grieves me on your behalf to the very bottom of my Soul, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſo much diſingenuous bitterneſs in a man of your Character. But ſince you are ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to know no bounds of moderation, I muſt touch your miſcarriages a little lightly. After the Ceſſion of <hi>King James,</hi> I ſaid the Succeſſion was not violently broken. And in anſwer to this you mentioned the <hi>Dutch Guards</hi> aſſigned by the Prince to attend <hi>King James</hi> before his Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; And this you falſly call a cloſe confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for had it been ſuch, how had he ſo eaſie liberty of going off? But whatever this was, it was before the Ceſſion, and then what is this to the after proceedings of the Convention, of which alone I was ſpeaking as not violent? Then you as improperly require the Conſent of <hi>King James,</hi> and your <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> who muſt be ſerved firſt, as antecedent in the Courſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent. Now I muſt tell you, that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, ſome, who, thro' joy of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, having forgotten that Compaſſion, which I deeply have for all Royal Tragedies, would be apt to make a jeſt of this, and reply upon you, that they have been ſerved well enough in the firſt place, before the Prince and Princeſs
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102364:43"/>of <hi>Orange,</hi> who are well enough ſerved too, and all as they deſerve. But I ſhall only obſerve your inconſiderateneſs of diſcourſe in bringing in <hi>King James</hi> into the Catalogue of his own Heirs after his Ceſſion, upon which I ſaid the Succeſſion was not violently broken, but altered by the conſent of the next Heirs. And this, I think, I may ſtill defend without breach of modeſty, even tho' I ſhould allow the proceedings of the Convention to have been violations of his Right. For a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Expulſion of a Poſſeſſor may conſiſt with the true Succeſſion of the next Reverſioners. But admitting the Ceſſion, or Abdication for real, what need was there to ſolicit his further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our Eſtabliſhments? And for your <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> beſide the doubt of the Nation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deſcent, the late Queen brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Ceſſion before the Ceſſion and Abdication of the King, nor were there any Claims entred for him before the Convention, and ſo he might be legally neglected for want of Claimer. I know this has been charged on the Prince, and the Convention for not admitting the Diſcuſſion of that Deſcent. But, I think, no Law could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to move it <hi>ex officio,</hi> when he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and no Promoter appeared on his behalf. But further, to enquire into the Equity hereof, if <hi>King James</hi> at the Prince's demand had called a Parliament, that had been one of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Articles to have been judicially determined by the Parliament between them. But <hi>King James</hi> not calling a Parliament, nor allowing the Convention power of Judgment herein, there was no reaſon ſuch a Queſtion ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, which, if determined againſt <hi>King James,</hi> and his <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> ſhould not have concluded them, but, if given againſt the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſhould have confined and excluded
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102364:43"/>her. As to your politick ſtroke upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> I ſhall reflect no more than this, that if ſhe will permit you to the Conduct of her Counſels, ſhe is like to thrive mightily by it. For you will adviſe her either to preſent flight, or ſedition, only to make way for I know not what, or how many new Princes of another Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe real Deſcent no one ſhould ever know but the Men of the Myſteries. Perhaps your Agents have laid the Seeds of Diſcontent between the two Princely Ladies already, in order to form your other Projects; but I hope that God, that has hitherto preſerved them in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rights, againſt all the Arts of thoſe who would have illegitimated, or intercepted their Suceſſion, will ſtill preſerve her Royal Highneſs from the Snares you lay for her. And ſince you have blurted out the Secret to the Publick, ſhe, and the whole Kingdom have reaſon to take cloſe notice of it.</p>

But if your Judges, Sheriffs, or other Officers join with, and aſſiſt ſuch a wicked Son, or Daughter, to effect ſuch an Evil Act, or do applaud and approve it, when they know it be done by ſuch wicked and unlawful Acts, then their being Officers of Law will rather increaſe than diminiſh their Guilt.</hi> T.

                        <p>Now all this I allow too, whether done judicially, or in forms of Law, or no. But if it be done in private, and not in Legal Forms, it is nothing to our purpoſe, or my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. But if the Judges ſit in Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, and very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly caſt the Father in his Cauſe, yet it being done in form of Law, the Judgment will paſs into ſuch Execution, as will be taken for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally legal, tho' the Judgment be morally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and contract an heinous Guilt on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Judge. So that ſtill the Subject People are innocent in admitting the Acts of the Convention as Legal, tho' really before God they had been Unrighteous Judges. Yet becauſe you herein ſharpen a Dart againſt the King and Queen, tho' I never intended my Objection to ſuch a Reflection, the Caſe you ſet is not parallel to ours. For the Convention ſate not in Judgment between the Father, and Son, and Daughter, the Father not being ſubject in Law, nor ſubmitting his Cauſe to them; but when the Father had left his Royal Eſtate, the Prince calls them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to ſettle the forſaken State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they did as it now ſtands. And as this Judgment was in Form, Legal, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative, ſo you cannot prove it immoral, or injurious. For as the Eſtates were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to enquire into the temper of Spirit in the Conteſt between the Father and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren toward each other, which was not of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Cognizance, ſo they debated only the Civil Purpoſes of <hi>King James</hi>'s Actions, and how the ſtate of this Land might be legally and ſecurely fixed after his Deſertion, in which they acted as Legal Judges, and no otherwiſe. What was done before, or out of Convention by any of the Members, and the inner motions, and aims
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102364:44"/>of particular mens minds there ſitting during theſe agitations, theſe are extrajudicial, and ſo not chargeable on the whole Court as a Council of State, as being no parts of their formal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.</p>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my inſtance was, that ſuch Pirates, and Tyrants often ſeize on ſuch as they have no Right of Dominion over, and may perhaps threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to torture, or deſtroy them, except they ſubmit, and contract a perpetual Servitude by Oath, or other forms of engagement, which they under ſuch Exigences may lawfully yield to.

And any other violent and illegal Forms of Expulſion, and Admiſſion quadrate not with our Caſe.</p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:102364:45"/>
                        <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis a very ſilly ſuppoſition, and never any where exemplified in Fact, that all the Tenants (under a ſtate of National Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſhould violently out a true, and put in a wrong Landlord <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> and ſwear, and pay the wrong Poſſeſſor all the Duties of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage accuſtomed, when the Lord that is in by Law, will bring the ſtrength of the Country to reduce them.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You cannot duly apply this to our preſent Caſe of Allegiance. For all <hi>King James</hi>'s Subjects did not concur to out him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violently, or judicially, nor conſequently to bring in the Stranger, which is the form in which you ſtate the Caſe of Rebellious Tenants. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe however my parallel holds good, that if a great many of the Tenants conſpire with a Stranger, and bribe the Judges to a corrupt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the old true Landlord, who being thereby ejected, the Stranger comes in by forms of Law, I ſay ſtill, the reſt innocent Tenants, tho' conſcious of the Wrong, may ſwear Homage, and Fealty to the New, <hi>de facto,</hi> Landlord. And ſo here put the Caſe, as you would have it, at the worſt, that never ſo great a part of <hi>King James</hi>'s Subjects had with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> actually conſpired againſt him, and made him fly, and thereupon a National Court aſſembling to ſit upon the Tenure of his Eſtate, had been corrupted to give wrong Judgment againſt him for the Prince, yet the form of Proceſs being le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, the innocent Subjects may, or muſt take him for their Royal Landlord, that is in by Forms of Law, and ſwear him the cuſtomary Homage, and Fealty. But for the juſtice of that Judgment I have fully advocated already, and ſo in this place ſhall have no need to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition.</p>

                           <hi>all violations of all thoſe Decencies, that are yet, notwithſtanding her Marriage, due by the Fifth Commandment to her Father, which are conſiſtent with her Husbands Rights and Intereſts, and in her Rightful Power to perform?</hi> But this was another inconſiderable, which you in great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity have omitted, that it might not juſtifie my piety to the Fifth Commandment, and prevent all occaſion of reproach. But I think you are a very looſe Caſuiſt for a Wife between the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of Husband and Father, if you think that the Husbands Power limits the Wife only in thoſe Commands of the Father, that are in themſelves inconſiſtent with the Duties of a Wife, whether the Husbands prohibition intervene or no; (for except this be your meaning, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, nor againſt me.) For it is not the Husbands Power, but the Law of God, that binds the Wife from the violation of her Duties to her Husband, as it does bind her to keep her Duties to her Parents, and all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, even Subjects, that have no power over her. But by your favour, if a Father commands a Married Daughter in any indifferent thing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting in it ſelf no ill to her. Husband, ſhe has no abſolute Authority to promiſe, or do it, but on grant, or juſt preſumption of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands leave; for if he forbid it at any time before it is done, the Wives hands are in duty bound up from the performance, and how faulty ſoever the Son in Law be in his perverſe and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102364:47"/>needleſs inhibitions, the Daughter is diſcharged of all Guilt in the non-compliance to her Fa-Father. So that, ſtrictly ſpeaking, all Imperial Power, meerly human, is in things, that in themſelves are left at liberty by the Laws of God. And now whether I have ſaid any thing more, or worſe than this, ſpeak out without wrigling, and ſubterfuge. And yet to deal openly with you, and piouſly (I hope) with the Laws of my Creator, I think there is a great latitude of equity in this Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and that it conſiſts not in a meer indiviſible point, nor is founded meerly in the Relation, but the Cauſes and Deſigns of it by the Ordinance of God and Nature. For Parents being Vice-Gods to their Children, while under their Family and Dominion, the more they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God in their Offices of Piety, eſpecially toward God and their Children, the more their Children are bound to honour them, even when they are ſent off from the Houſe of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to found new Families, and to ſubſiſt freely by themſelves. For tho' the ties of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubjection are then looſed, yet the Duties of Honour ſtill remain uncancelled. But if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents recede from their Piety toward God, the common and Supreameſt Father of all, the greater this impiety of Parents is, the leſs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due to them even from their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And I truly am of Opinion, that if ſuch Impiety grow up to perfect Atheiſm, or Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, from which all the long and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Supplications of the Children cannot reduce them, the Chidren are diſcharged from all the Offices of Perſonal Honour toward them, tho' not of Pity and Compaſſion for them. And upon this ground the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> does not exempt Enticers to Idolatry from the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102364:48"/>even of the neareſt Relations, Deut. 13.6, to 11. <hi>If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother, or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy Boſom, or thy Friend, which is as thine own Soul, entice thee, ſaying, Let us go, and ſerve other Gods — Thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken unto him, neither ſhall thine Eye pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare, neither ſhalt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal him; But thou ſhalt ſurely kill him; thine Hand ſhall be firſt upon him, to put him to death, and afterward the Hand of all the People. And thou ſhalt ſtone him with Stones, that he die, becauſe he ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. So that all ſuch Perſons were by the Law of God looked on as a common Peſtilence, not to be honoured, loved, or cheriſhed, but deſtroyed by the neareſt Relations.</p>

                        <p>But Parents here being omitted out of this exact Catalogue of other Relations, it ſhews them to be not within this Law; and therefore that this Law does not derogate from the Honour due to Parents by the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, tho' they entice their Children to Idolatry; the Reaſon being grounded on the Authority of Parents over Children, which would be nulled, if Children might proſecute this Law upon their Parents.

                        <p>If you will literally interpret this Law only of the very Relations that are expreſſed, than all other, even leſs Relations, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, which is unreaſonable. But if you will argue <hi>a majori ad minus,</hi> that if none of theſe Relations are exempt, ſurely no leſs Relations ought to be judged diſcharged; then the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Parents to Children being leſs than that of the Wife to the Husband, and no greater
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102364:48"/>than that of Children to Parents, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within this Law. Nor could their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Authority indemnifie them, for all that was from, and under God, and was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> forfeit, whenſoever they rejected God for Idols. Otherwiſe ſuch an exempted Authority of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents muſt have been a Snare to the Children, to draw them from the Lord their God, or at leaſt to reſtrain them from aſſerting their God impartially againſt all his Enemies. And in the ſame Chapter, Idolatrous Cities were to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed by all the reſt of the People, without regard to any Relations dwelling in them; for when the Judgment of God was paſt upon them, all Natural Relation and Authority ceaſed as to all conſequent offices of Reſpect, Love, or Honour, when the impious Apoſtates were convict, and doomed to exciſion. 'Tis true indeed, that Law, being in its penal ſanction but poſitive, local, and judicial, does not oblige us, but the natural reaſon ſubſtrate thereto ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and indicates all obligations of Duty from all Relations whatſoever forfeited by Atheiſm, and avowed Irreligion. And accordingly <hi>Aſa</hi> diſhonoured his Mother in deveſting her of her Royal Dignity, becauſe ſhe had made an Idol in a Grove, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16. Nor is this any breach of the Law of Nature, but the obſervation of it, for the Law of Nature being nothing elſe but pure Abſtract Reaſon and Equity, whatſoever is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this Equity, comports with the Laws of our Nature. By theſe Laws the ſins of Men-reſcind their Rights in many benefits, which had been due to them in a ſtate of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Law of God requires us ſimply to honour all men, it being the natural due of our beings framed after the Image of God; and yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102364:49"/>wicked and ungodly men are to be ſhunned as ſpots and blemiſhes by the Law of Nature, and to be made Anathema by the Cenſure of the Church. For the Foundation of all Authority whatſoever is God, and all Obligations to all Duties, Civil, Moral, and Religious, are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him; ſo that an avowed rejection of God, puts men out of all claims of Authority, which alone is originally Gods, for a renunciation of God is an effectual renunciation of all juſt and real Authority whatſoever. The Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment therefore being not a meer poſitive Precept, but a dictate of Natural Equity, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretable to particular Acts according to the Rules of Equity, and muſt concede to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and more important Obligations, which will ſometimes require us to hate Father and Mother (that is, to diſregard their Commands, and forſake their Perſons) to keep Gods Commandments, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. If a Son be a King, and the Father a Subject, he muſt deal with his own Father as a Subject in Civil Cauſes, nay as a Malefactor, if neceſſity requires. A Son is bound to defend (even by the Sword, if there be no other way) his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the Sword of his Father, and to ſave his Country by the Detection of his Fathers Treaſons. And many ſuch Caſes more there may be, wherein intolerable wickedneſs on one hand, and greater Obligations on the other, cut off the Ties of Honour and Union, between Parents and Children, Husbands and Wives, and all other Temporal Relations; ſince what ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates men from God, may well diſengage them one from another. And to put a particular Caſe, if a Prince marry a Kings Daughter and Heireſs, and the King after becomes ſuſpected of an Impoſture, to pervert that Daughters
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102364:49"/>inheritance, and upon demand will not refer that doubt to the Arbitration of his own Senate, but to elude the Hopes, and juſt Expectations of his Son in Law, Daughter, and his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in this, and other momentous Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he puts all the Laws, Liberties and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of his Kingdoms in a Courſe of Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ruin under Arbitrary and Foreign Powers, may not ſuch a Son in Law endeavour to put a ſtop to theſe Meaſures, and to force ſuch a King to do right? And is ſuch Prince's Wife bound to oppoſe her Husband in theſe juſt Cauſes, to abet her Fathers injuſtice and unnatural Impiety? And if the Father being thus preſſed by the Son in Law, rather than do the juſtice demanded, will fly for the ſuccour of his injuſtice to another unjuſt King, the Enemy of his People, and in the mean time leave his Kingdom in Confuſion, which ſhall ſubject it more effectually to his Scourge upon his return with Foreign Forces, may not ſuch Prince, and ſuch Kings Daughter, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Nation unite, and ſettle it againſt the ruins otherwiſe inevitable to them all? For if Natural Ties ſometimes give place to Civils of greater weight, here ſurely is as fair, and juſt an inſtance for it, as well can be imagined, or alledged out of Hiſtory. And that Civil Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of greater moment do preponderate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Natural, you your ſelf confeſs, when you rightly ſay, had not the conſtitution been for the time being lawfully altered, the Crown coming to the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> by meer Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, the Prince here muſt have been her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, tho' by the Matrimonial Laws of Nature he is her Lord. It is indeed a melancholy Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, when the impieties of ſuch near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations break off all the Natural Links of Duty and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102364:50"/>Union, which muſt never be receded from as long as the Union is tolerable, and conſiſtent with Superior Obligations; but of two Evils the leaſt is always to be choſen, and where two Offices are incompetible, the more important is to be proſecuted. And yet, tho' this be lawful and neceſſary, 'tis ſometimes a Tragical Scene, under which even the Righteous Parties are to mourn, and lament their infelicity in falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Straits and Temptations, and are inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to pray, that God would put a juſt and good End to the Diſaſter, and in the mean time to make neceſſary Juſtice and Piety the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule and Reaſon of their Actions in ſuch a State of Diviſion, and inevitable Contention. And ſuch being the form of the preſent Affairs, if you needs will cenſure the Morals of your Sovereigns, you ought to allow their Meaſures all the Charity the Caſe will bear, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſeems the Care of Gods Eſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for us; And if it be ſo; it is a dangerous thing to Curſe whom the Lord hath Bleſſed. But I have told you, theſe things concern not us in our Civils, and it is therefore beſt to leave things ſecret, and above us, unto God, the Lord and Judge of all men. But as to the Change it ſelf, it is an apparent delivery and bleſſing to the Nation in the beſt manner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by any means leſs than ſupernatural. For a deliverance it is plain we needed, which could never have been ſecured, had <hi>King James</hi> continued undiſturbed in his Reign. Now if an unrelated Prince had deſired to help us, yet he had had no Civil Intereſts to have grounded a defence, or reſcue us from any Civil Laws, or Laws of War. Then the Sovereignty given to a Stranger had been a cutting off the Line Royal, which neither <hi>Atwood,</hi> or <hi>Johnſon</hi> have

Then again, if the Princeſs of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> had invaded her Fathers Kingdom and Crown by any Hoſtile Forms, this would have looked more violent and unnatural, and ſeems more than the Princely Lady in Temper or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could well or eaſily have attempted.

                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102364:51"/>Book into publick Light by the hand of my Lord Arch-Biſhop <hi>Sancroft</hi> in this very Juncture, all your Pleas would have chiefly ſtuck in the Laws of God, whoſe violation with you ſhould have been alone ſufficient to have nulled all Rights, and Titles. But now as it is, you are pinched by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and the Edition of that Book, and forced againſt your wills to own it, and have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief but in forced Arts of Evaſion. Such is that demure Proteſtation, that you do not think Dominion founded in Grace, which you know was, and is a pretence <hi>toto coelo</hi> diſtant from our matter, as claiming all Secular Rights by virtue of their Religious Character, or Election. But will you allow, that a full and legal form of Settlement can be founded in any Act really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious? I would have you ſpeak out without boggling, or clouting your Tongue. If not, then the Defect of Plenitude in ſuch Settlements ſtands in the iniquity, and breach of moral Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Gods Commandments. And in truth this at laſt is the true Engliſh of all thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, on which you complain, that we have no Settlement, nor any thing like a good Title, tho' thoſe Reaſons are wrapped up in forms of words chiefly relating to Civil Laws. For the ſum of all is; the Poſſeſſion of another mans Right is no full Settlement, becauſe it has no good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as being a violation of Right, and Gods Commandments. Of which I ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perhaps to diſcourſe more anon. In the mean time, as I have already given you part of my ſenſe herein, ſo will I now deliver and ſettle it as full; <hi>viz.</hi> That when ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons claim Right, then <hi>pendente lite,</hi> either in Law, or War, the Legal Preſumption of Right muſt be for the quiet Poſſeſſor; but after judgment given to be in the perſon to whom
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102364:52"/>it is adjudged, till reverſe of judgement, and all other antecedent Titles and Pretenſions are to be deemed null and ceſſant to all Civil Effects and Conſtructions, whatſoever the Errors, or mens private Senſes herein may be; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Titles muſt not be taken to be good, and ſtill in being, tho' new claims and conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be promoted by the outed Party. Which being premiſed, I can eaſily yield you, that that can be no good Title, againſt which there are prior or better Titles [apparently] in being, conteſting, and claiming, and that it is no full and Legal Settlement, where an [apparently] bad Title is by bad means [ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently] maintained againſt a Title [appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently] juſt and good. But this is not to be taken in a judged Cauſe. But who was Judge between <hi>King James</hi> and <hi>King William,</hi> while the former diſputed the new Poſſeſſion of the later with the Sword, to determine the Civil Practice of the Nation? If none, then were we to abide by <hi>King Williams</hi> quiet form of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; If there were any Judge, it was foreign, or domeſtick; Now there neither was, nor could be a foreign Judge to oblige us; if do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, it was either private, or publick; if private, that cannot oblige the whole Nation; if publick, then it was in the Eſtates conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but they have judged <hi>King James</hi>'s Title void and Ceſſant, and not in being, and ſo, tho' extrajudicially claimed, neither juſt, nor good. But if you will neither allow quiet Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, nor publick Judgment as a Rule to State Titles Legally, but will throw up all to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinions, or Humours, you diſſolve all the ties of Civil Society into Eternal Wars, and Commotions. But becauſe you clamour that we have no Settlement, I will make further Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102364:52"/>and prove the Admiſſion of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties by the Eſtates of this Land to be a full and proper Settlement, tho' againſt <hi>King James</hi>'s claim and conteſt, from the Laws of this Land, the univerſal Uſage of all Nations, natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Holy Scripture.</p>

                        <p>Firſt then I begin with the common Laws of this Nation, which are nothing elſe but the conſtant and general Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> which Lawyers juſtifie for good and binding upon a fair preſumption of their Deſcent to us from ſome immemorial Compoſitions Real and National made by our Fore-fathers; whoſe Acts and Contracts for future Ages do by the Laws of all Nations bind their Poſterities, (that are yet in their Loins, as in the loweſt degree of minority) till they are validly vacated. And ſuch Obligations are juſtified by ſacred Inſtances, as in the Oath of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Children to carry <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Bones out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and <hi>Noah, Abraham, Moſes,</hi> in the League of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Gibcon,</hi> and all other their National Contracts, and the Laws of <hi>Jonadab</hi> on the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> &amp;c. So that fidelity to the Contracts, Ordinances, and Compoſitions Real of our Fathers, and Anceſtors obliges us to the Cuſtoms, that yet continue as the Common Laws of <hi>England</hi> from that ſuppoſed Original; And thus their Legal Obligation is founded not in Force, but in Truth and Honeſty. Which being premiſed, I add, that our Nation in theſe two laſt Parliaments, after a full Debate hath judged their Admiſſion of <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary</hi> according to our Laws, Legal, and the ſecond Parliament hath moreover recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed them <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of Right according to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102364:53"/>thoſe Laws. And the firſt Parliament upon this Conſtitution fixed on them the full Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Subject to be ſecured by Oath as much as to any other Kings whatſoever, that ſo they might thro'ly make this preſent Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment full and entire, which therefore they judged to be ſuch according to our Laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any concurrence, and notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the <hi>Late King,</hi> which on his Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Abdication could in their Judgment create no defect in this preſent Settlement, ſince the Confuſion and Anarchy, we were put into thereby, did in their Judgments give them a Legal Right to reſettle as they could under the then Exigences for the Common Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor did they judge us tied to a State of continued Anarchy during <hi>King James</hi>'s pleaſure, that while he provided for himſelf in <hi>France,</hi> by his own private Counſels, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Nation, we ſhould be at no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at home to provide for our ſelves againſt a Ruin otherwiſe impendent and inevitable. And if we look back to all the Changes in the Succeſſion ever ſince there have been two Houſes of Parliament, the full and final Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after all Ruptures, Diſorders, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes hath determined in the Recognitions, and Allegiances enacted by theſe Parliaments, even without the conſent, and againſt the preſumed claim of the outed Competitors, tho' theſe were ſometimes Lineal Heirs, and preſent in the Land. Much leſs then is ſuch conſent, or ceſſation of pretence, or claim in the relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abſent Competitors neceſſary to the fulneſs, and validity of ſuch Settlements. And tho' the Diſpoſſeſſed afterward moved Stirs and Wars againſt thoſe paſt Settlements, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes no Argument againſt their real plenitude
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102364:53"/>for the time being in form of Law; for by thoſe new Commotions they deſigned to reduce themſelves into ſuch a full form of Settlement by Parliamentary Recognitions, out of which, by preſent Wars they deſigned to eject their ſettled Adverſaries; for to a fuller Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they could never raiſe themſelves by the greateſt force and ſucceſſes whatſoever. Thus all the precedent Uſages in ſuch caſes lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eſtates, firſt in Convention, and ſince that in Parliament, and according to theſe have they made this Settlement as legally full and Obligatory as 'twas poſſible, as judging it to be ſo full in its own Nature and Reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preſent Defects, or Capacities of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <p>I wonder you cannot obſerve here, what you readily can, when it makes for you, that the firſt Conſtituting Parliament did not recognize <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary</hi> to be <hi>de jure,</hi> but excluded that Aſſertion out of the Oath. But the ſecond Parliament recognized their Right, tho' hereby, as you will ſay, they added nothing of that intention to the Oath. Now then the firſt Settlement, to which thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tacked, bears proportion, going no further than a Conſtitution <hi>de facto,</hi> was not at the full, becauſe it came not up to the fuller Recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>de jure;</hi> which being judicially apparent is with you the Legal Form of Title, and Ground of Allegiance. And ſo the Oath being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Settlement that was not thro'ly full, cannot by Biſhop <hi>Overals</hi> Convocation Book be proved due from both Clergy and Laity, for that the Settlement to be ſworn to was herein defective.

                        <p>It will be as eaſie for you to obſerve, as for me to remark, that the Recognition is but a Declaration, not a Conſtitution of Right; and ſo adds nothing of Right, that before was really wanting; but more fully declares the Right, that ſtands and is founded in the firſt Conſtitution, which actually was at full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' not ſo fully declared; this Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being deſigned not only to repreſs the Contradictions of their Majeſties Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but to compoſe, as much as might be, mens Doubts and Surmiſes, and perhaps this your very Objection hereupon. But whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the Rights, Titles, or Pretenſions of Princes to Crowns antecedent to the actual Settlement, they may be fair preparations, and grounds of claim, but they enter not into the eſſential form, and conſtituent Reaſon of a full actual Settlement, which commences and conſiſts purely in a Legal Form of Admiſſion by the Eſtates of this Realm judging for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may lawfully admit this, or that Pretender or Sollicitor, even when they are not permitted to judge any thing on the Right of his demand of ſuch Admiſſion, which belongs to the Queſtion <hi>de jure.</hi> And to thoſe that are thus <hi>de facto</hi> ſettled, whether they had any real antecedent Right of claiming, or no, the National Allegiance is by publick Contract always given to the full, without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Meaſures, Forms, or Abatements. And this is not only otherwiſe evident, but is made more ſo by this preſent Recognition. For this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102364:54"/>ſecond Parliament, that enacted this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Recognition of Right, gave, and could give no further Allegiance than had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given on the meer Legal Form of Actual Settlement, which they in their zeal would have done undoubtedly, had they judged the firſt Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement any wiſe deficient in it ſelf, or its Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a plenary Allegiance, which yet however is of no other form, or virtue than that Allegiance which is always given even to meer Kings <hi>de facto.</hi> Which ſhews the ſenſe of our Nation to be, that by our Law Allegiance is given to Kings, not on the account of an antecedent real Title to the Crown, but on the account of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Form of Settlement into the Actual Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, upon which there is no ſuperiour Judge to hear, nor determin Quarrels, and Claims of Titles. And you that require more to the nature of a full Settlement, require more than the Convocation has done, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns your Allegiance to the<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Can. <hi>27.</hi>
                           </note> King <hi>de facto,</hi>

                           </note> a full and thorow Settlement, owning the original wickedneſs of the ſeizure to be no Legal Bar or impeachment to the Authority of their Government, into which they are formally and fully ſettled. And ſuch was the State of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> in the Empire, when the two great Apoſtles required Chriſtian Subjection to them, not on the moral juſtice of their Titles, of which they could be no Judges, but on their actual ſettlement in the Conceſſion and Submiſſion of the Senate, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102364:55"/>other popular Powers. And ſuch alſo was the reaſon of ſubjection in thoſe inſtanced Changes, on which that Convocation wiſely grounded this their now celebrious Determination. But ſince you have again upbraided me with Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> I cannot chooſe but obſerve how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally men, that run into contrary extreams, do meet in the other ſide of the Sphere, as you and your greateſt. Adverſaries do in this preſent Controverſie; And you both therefore fall into the ſame abſurdities. Now here Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> either underſtands not the formal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a full Settlement, of if he does, he is inconſiſtent with himſelf. For if (as I have proved) a National Admiſſion conſtitutes a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, how can Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> explode Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he places the Right of Kings in the Admiſſion of the People? But if he requires any moral juſtice, to make the Act of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Rightful, then if the People fail in that moral Juſtice, how can their Conſtitution be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Right, by which Juſtice it ſelf is violated? And ſuch failure in a People is no impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, except you will entitle them to an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sanctity in all popular Actions. As for example; Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> produces but one Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51.</note> out of <hi>Knyghton,</hi> to prove, that Kings acting perverſly againſt the Laws may be depoſed, and ſome one of the Royal Race advanced by the Peers, and People. I will not now ſtrive to weaken the Authority and Credit of the Author herein, nor the Truth of that Power, which the then Lords and Commons claimed againſt their King, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I alledge the many Changes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ſince, that ſeem to have abrogated the popular right of Abrogation; but ſuppoſe that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102364:55"/>this ſtill is the Right of the Nation againſt their Kings, yet if the People ſhould on falſe pretences and imputations abrogate their King, this Act could not be morally Juſt and Right, tho' it were in form legal; and if the Subjects, that are innocent, are not to admit what is thus externally Legal, except it be alſo altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rightful, then are they not bound to ſtand by any Popular Abrogations, which they know, or judge to be morally faulty, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may oppoſe all new Titles, if they are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the real Right of ſuch Abrogations. And to come cloſe home to the Caſe, if <hi>King James</hi> were not really guilty of every one of thoſe Enormities to a Title, upon which ſuch Statute did legitimate the Abrogation, and the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had really abrogated their King without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate conviction of all thoſe guilts recited by that loſt or undiſcoverable Statute quoted by <hi>Knyghton,</hi> then had their Abrogation been a nullity, as not being Rightful. But further, if men ſhall object, that <hi>Knyghtons</hi> relation of a Statute, not ſeen by himſelf, but only ſaid to be objected by the Peers and the Commons, is not a Record, nor a valid Teſtimony to any Civil Conſequences, as being not upon Oath, liable to Error, and uncapable of judicial forms of Diſcuſſion, beſides its ſingularity, where ſhall we find a bottom to authorize <hi>King James</hi>'s abrogation? For 'tis not enough to a Judicial Conviction, or effect or ſurmiſe, that <hi>Richard</hi> deſtroyed that Statute in the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon ſuch a general crimination that he defaced Statutes, of which there is no particular form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction extant, no not in <hi>Knyghton,</hi> who yet is the only Traditor of this Tranſaction; but you muſt bring us legal proof for what muſt legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern us. And yet nothing elſe that Mr.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102364:56"/>
                           <hi>Johnſon</hi> hath cited out of Law Books, nor <hi>King John</hi>'s Charter in the <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> doth amount to a Popular Right of Abrogation, but only to a limited power of reſiſting Kings on their oppreſſion of the Laws and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that whatſoever has in fact been done toward our ſeveral Changes, muſt not all be taken, or ſworn to as Right, but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Settlements, by National Acts muſt be taken for formally Legal for the time being, and ſubmitted to under that Notion, leaving the real Right of the procedures to Gods judgment, becauſe there is none other under Heaven to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt it above the National Sanctions.</p>

                        <p>If you are not inwardly convinced of the truth of their Judgment upon their Power, and of the lawfulneſs of their Conſtitution found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon, I cannot help that. Neither is the Care of the State ſo much concerned to enforce ſuch an inward conviction, tho' it is to perſwade it, and to ſilence Contradictions. But, as I have often told you, Judicial Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt overbear all private ones to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102364:56"/>as to all Civil Conſequences. This the peace of mankind, the neceſſity of ending Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and the fundamental Reaſons of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment do univerſally require; ſo that you muſt aſſign ſome Superior Court, or Judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom to be determined by, if you will not ſtand to their Judgment, or expoſe all to private judgments; the firſt of which is impoſſible to be ſworn, and the later impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable in a Society. And to turn the dull point of this Objection on your ſelf; the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament doth not think it reaſonable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Private Judgments, eſpecially thoſe of the profeſſed Enemies of their long-ſettled and immemorial Authority.

Will you here ſet your Private Judgments in battle array againſt the Authority and Judgment of the whole Nation, and the Publick Eſtates thereof? Or whether Opinion muſt concede in order to Publick Peace? So that here your imprudent Zeal on falſe Notions of Loyalty hurries you into Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples abſolutely Seditious and Deſtructive to the Legal Conſtitution of all Governments, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that, which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have themſelves eſtabliſhed.</p>

For the meer force, or victory of the Sword gives no Right, or Authority even over a vanquiſhed People, till they federally reſign to the Conqueror, and then much leſs doth it ſo in a Nation not conquered. But to omit the Laws of pure Conqueſts, there are inſtances
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102364:57"/>enough of Abdications, Ceſſions, and Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as many, I believe, and more than of ſimple and proper Victories) to ſet out the ſenſe of all Nations by. For upon all ſuch the places quitted admitted ſuch conſequent Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the ſtraits, they were caſt into, would permit, as is manifeſt in the leaving of Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Holds, or Countries. And the truth is, there is the ſame reaſon upon all proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and other Surrendries, that legitimates the admiſſion of a Change, <hi>viz.</hi> the neceſſity of preſerving the Publick Body from ruins and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations.</p>

But what Reaſon can you ſhew for it in our Caſe, which is ſo very plain and obvious, that we were at liberty to have preſerved our Sovereign, and our ſelves together, and if ſo, how can this Settlement be admitted for legal, or be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted full againſt the ſo juſt Claims of our real Sovereign?</p>

                        <p>Here again you tranſgreſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per limits of a private Judgment, when you take upon you to ſay, that we, (<hi>i. e.</hi> our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention) could have ſecured <hi>King James</hi> in his Throne, and this Nation in its Rights, and Properties. But in the main point, where you ſtick, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſent of <hi>King James,</hi> and your <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> you are very unreaſonable. For ſhall he, who at laſt put all his Subjects into confuſion by his leaving the Government, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from ſettling, till he give us his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Or muſt the Conſent of a Infant be waited,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102364:58"/>who, if he ever was, or yet is, is in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and diſpoſal of an Enemy King, who would ſettle him, and us too with a witneſs, if he had but a lucky Wind, and a fair Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? It is poſſible, that an offended Prince may meditate revenge on a People, that will not yield up all to the inſatiable claims of boundleſs Prerogative. And Deſertion would be the cheapeſt, ſureſt, and ſevereſt way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, if they muſt never ſettle again till he pleaſe to authorize them; and this truly would be the ſtrangeſt of all Prerogatives. There are alſo that ſay, that <hi>King James</hi>'s Prieſts coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled, and his Queen engaged him to go off, on this very account, that we might fall into ſuch Plagues thro' our Diviſions, and unſettled Looſeneſs, as ſhould enable him to return with an abſolute plenitude of Arbitrary Power. But not to depend on uncertain fames with their oblique conſtructions, what can the legal language of that Ceſſion ſpeak to his Loyal People but this? I have disbanded my Army, and will not conteſt it with the Sword. I ſhift for my ſelf, and muſt leave you to ſhift for your ſelves and ſettlement as you can. Since I yield to my fears and neceſſities, ſo may you. If even a Natural Parent, to ſave his own life, leaves his Son to the mercy of his Enemies. the Son may contract Peace, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to that his Fathers Enemy for his own preſervation, nor can the meer Natural Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Intereſt of the Father in the Son va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate moral Obligation of ſuch Contract, till that power of his Enemy over his Son be otherwiſe legally diſſolved by the Laws of War, Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, or otherwiſe. So that, tho' we ſhould allow you, that all <hi>King James</hi>'s Enemies ſinned in procuring this new Settlement upon us all,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102364:58"/>yet his moſt Loyal Subjects may moſt innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit, from the reaſon of the thing, and the virtual Conceſſion hereunto in the voice of his Deſertion, which muſt be ſuppoſed as made to his faithful Adherents, tho' not to his Enemies. So that ſhould he ever return again, he could not in any juſtice puniſh the meer ſubmiſſion to this new Settlement in thoſe, who contributed nothing to it. And you that refuſe it, refuſe that liberty, which his Deſertion legally gave you by all Civil Interpretations. All which put together ſhould be of great might with you to admit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubmiſſion as Legal. Nor ought his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed Conteſts to be taken as Legal, or juſt bars to the contrary. For if there were ſuch a Virtual and Legal Conceſſion in his Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Eſtates of his People, taking the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, have provided for us a Settlement upon that Conceſſion, which being paſſed and confirmed, the ſuppoſed revocation of that Conceſſion, by a new War, or Inauthorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Declarations, is null, void and unoblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſo here was, tho' not a Verbal, yet a Legal Cenſent of <hi>King James,</hi> which is as much as you your ſelves can in reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to the juſtifying our preſent Submiſſion, and to the plenitude of our preſent Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

And you being men of Religion, that can dare to ſuffer for what you think right and ſacred, will be like to have greater reſpect to good and clever Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the Holy Oracles. We will therefore conſider the ſeveral Settlements of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under Civil Forms of Government; and try whether their actual plenitude conſiſted in a National Contract, or any other bottom. And in order hereunto I ſhall obſerve two ſorts of Settlements among them, one Conſequent to an Antecedent Right and Title, the other conſtituent of the Title to, and in the Sovereignty. And according to this Order I begin with the former.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then God, upon a good original and antecedent Title, actually ſettles himſelf in the political Royalty, and Government of that People, (hence by Divines uſually called the Theocracy) by that Covenant at <hi>Sinai,</hi> by which he properly and peculiarly became their God and King alſo, and they his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not only under a Religious and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, but alſo a Civil Relation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp; alib. paſſim.</hi> When God himſelf, and <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet in God's Name, had entitled <hi>Saul</hi> to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102364:59"/>Unction, yet was he afterwards actually, and fully ſettled therein by the Popular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of true Allegiance to him, and was hence ſaid to be made, and choſen King, as well by the People, as by God and <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam. chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. Thus tho' <hi>David</hi>'s Title to that Succeſſion was divinely originated in the Unction of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. yet his full and actual Settlement over <hi>Judah</hi> conſiſting in his Unction by the People in <hi>Hebron,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. and after the death of <hi>Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi> he was thro'ly and actually ſettled over the other Tribes by their Covenant and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction tranſacted by their Elders, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> tho' deſigned by God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by <hi>David,</hi> and anointed by <hi>Zadock</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the full Title unto that Sovereignty, was yet finally and compleatly ſettled in that Throne of the Lord by the conſequent Acts and Unction of that People, as an Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on an antecedent Preſentation, and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Chron. Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. And thus to <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Paternal Title, the People were to add their Actual Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Settlement in like manner, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. And laſt of all <hi>Jehu,</hi> who by a Prophetick Unction, and Gods Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had a Divine Right and Title to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the Ten Tribes, and began to make way to his Actual Settlement by the ſlaughter of <hi>Joram, Ahaziah,</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> yet ſends to the Council at the Royal City <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and bids them ſettle the beſt and meeteſt of their Maſters Sons on the Throne of their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102364:60"/>Father <hi>Ahab,</hi> as knowing that that had been the uſual Office of the Senate. But they, not daring to oppoſe <hi>Jehu,</hi> tho' perhaps they knew nothing of his Prophetick Unction, reply, that they would not make any King, <hi>i. e.</hi> any but himſelf; but they contract a total ſubmiſſion to him, and ſealed that Contract in the Blood of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Sons, and ſo actually admitted him into the full Settlement and Poſſeſſion of that Sovereignty, 2 <hi>Kings Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. So that tho' theſe Titles to the Sovereignty were not founded in the Grant of the People, but of God, yet the full Settlement of all theſe New Kings, conſequent to their Titles, did conſiſt in the Publick Contract and Recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the People.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Peoples Concurrence was ſometimes conſtituent of a Title meerly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as well as a full and formal Settlement.</p>
                        <p>Thus the People would have given <hi>Gideon</hi> an hereditary Monarchy, <hi>Judges</hi> 8. as the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Gilead</hi> made <hi>Jephthah</hi> their Captain, <hi>Judges</hi> 11. and as the <hi>Shechemites</hi> did, what in them lay, entitle <hi>Abimelech, Judges</hi> 9. The Ten Tribes made <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King, which God, that had preingaged it by his Prophet, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by an inhibition againſt <hi>Rehoboams</hi> recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 2 <hi>Chron. Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. But <hi>Zimri,</hi> who reigned but ſeven days in <hi>Tirzah,</hi> without the full conſent of the whole People, wanted a good Title, as well as a full Settlement thereupon, and ſo was oppoſed by the Camp at <hi>Gibbethon,</hi> who ſet up <hi>Omri</hi> againſt him, and ſo he periſhed in a Fire of his own
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102364:60"/>kindling, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. And this was that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps which <hi>Jezabel</hi> objects to <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. <hi>Had</hi> Zimri <hi>peace, who ſlew his Maſter. Did the people permit him a full and peaceable Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Throne, who ſlow his own Sovereign?</hi> Which <hi>Omri</hi> however obtained after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of <hi>Tibni</hi> his Competitor, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.22, 23. Thus in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> after <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s death, the People of the Land took <hi>Jehoahaz:</hi> (probably the younger Brother to <hi>Eliakim</hi>) and made him King, And in that Act of the People the fulneſs of his Title, as well as his Actual Settlement, ſeems to have conſiſted, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. So that in ſhort, the Regular Conſtitution of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kings was, that ſubordinately to Gods Election the People ſhould ſettle each New Line according to the direction of the Law, Deut. 17.14, 15. <hi>When thou ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe,</hi> &amp;c. But in the degeneracy of the Ten Tribes they ſet up Kings by their own Act alone without waiting, or conſulting the Will of God, as he complains, Oſee 8.4. <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me; they have made them Princes, but I knew it not.</hi> Yet God's permiſſion hereof made the uſage valid to a Title meerly human, tho' done contrary to the Law. And therefore to <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha,</hi> who came in this way, God ſays, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.2. <hi>I have exalted thee out of the Duſt, and made thee Prince over my People</hi> Iſrael. Now theſe things in fact were done as well in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102364:61"/>to the Heirs-Royal, as to God; and yet the full and actual Settlement by the People, according to their modes, gave them a form of human Title, which was civily valid, tho' not, otherwiſe, and eſpecially Sacred. And to conclude, ſince it is recorded, that God at firſt granted them Kings at their requeſt after the manner of the Nations, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. it intimates, that this was then the Formal Rule of New Settlements, at leaſt among all the bordering Nations. However this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the People, being always the final Act, muſt needs give the laſt plenitude to the Settlement; and God ſurely, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of theſe Forms, muſt be granted to know, and judge them to be full, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, whatſoever elſe was, or might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſtituent of an antecedent Title, which the Convocation-Book does not make eſſentially ingredient to a full Settlement, or the Obligations to Allegiance founded thereupon. For if a Nations Settlement be not full under New Powers, till all the former lineal Heirs be Extinct, or ceaſe making their claims from Forreign Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, I know not how many Ages may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be neceſſary to fill the Settlement; and it will be very hard, if ſubmiſſion thereto, for want of ſuch a ground of plenitude, ſhould be Treaſon, and all Sanguinary Commotions againſt it Pious and Loyal, till the claim of all the Succeeding Heirs Lineal ſhall ſurceaſe for ever. Or if you will allow a term for Preſcription againſt all after claims, then you muſt allow that a Settlement attaining to Preſcription may exclude a Native
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102364:61"/>Right, or that a Native Right ceaſes by ſuch a Tract of Continuance. If it excludes Right only, then you are no more to comport with it, than with preſent Settlements excluſive; if the Right ceaſes, I pray ſhew me by what equity mere time can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a right in me <hi>Anno.</hi> 93. which was whole and within Memory <hi>Anno.</hi> 92. eſpecially ſince the Regeſtries of Lines Royal uſually endure as juſt Records, that will out-live the longeſt ocular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, and perſonal Memories whatſoever? For the reaſon why Preſcription paſſes Title is, when there is no Authentick Evidence, or memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to the contrary. And I will further note, that the ſame Laws of Nations, which admit preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as a form of Title, do not therefore aſſert the Title really right in the original means of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but only externally Legal for want of better Evidence; Preſcription in it ſelf being the weakeſt form of Title, that muſt give place to all others, if verified <hi>in foro;</hi> and its ground, or reaſon is only a ſuppoſed Compoſition Real, I ſay ſuppoſed only, not Aſſerted. And thoſe very Laws of Nations do not always ſuppoſe thoſe Compoſitions every way right, but only Legally Authoritative, and Settling, and do indeed allow ſuch preſent Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments within memory to be as Legal and Valid as thoſe, which being out of record and beyond memory, can but be ſuppoſed Legal, and this with more reaſon, becauſe men can better judge of what is preſent, than of what is paſt into a Tohu, an Age in which all things are forgotten.</p>

                        <p>I have kept you ſo long under the Fatigue, becauſe what I ever thought has lately appeared in your Prints, that the total ground of the Schiſm between us, lies in this point of Right. For you all ſay, that Allegiance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a thorow Settlement, but a thorow Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement is founded in the Right of him that Reigneth. So that if admit the wrong, then immediately all our Prayers for him are Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Polluted; and Abominable, as conteining Imprecations againſt the right and juſtice of him that is wronged, and giving God Praiſe for the Advancement of the Uſurper, which we blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly attribute to God. Whence there follows a neceſſity, that all good Biſhops, Prieſts, and People renounce Communion in theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, and with all that uſe them; and that, if hereupon they be deprived by the Uſurpers of all the Publick Advantages of their Miniſtry, they muſt keep up holy Miniſtrations among themſelves; for ſo the Rule is ſet, and agreed for with moſt prodigious Zeal, and no leſs Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy and Learning, by your admirable Author of Chriſtian Communion. But I wonder this great Man did not ſee, how Tottering and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual the viſible State of Religion then muſt be upon every turn of the ſecular State, and the various Competitions for the Sovereingty. For how is it poſſible that Godly Paſtors, and their Flocks, can be all unanimouſly certain at all times whore the real Right and Juſtice lies, when matters of Fact and Law are ſo remote from their Cogniſance? Nor will your evaſion of doubtful Caſes, which you allow much to,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102364:62"/>heal the matter. For in all ſuch caſes ſome will aſſert an indubitable Right, others a dubitable one, and that on both ſides at the ſame time: And thus your indubitable Men muſt fall into a ſtate of Schiſm or Separation from each other, upon their contrariant confidences in the Right of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Claimers: And your dubitable men muſt either be neuter to all Communion, or chooſe a Communion with one, or other of the indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at all adventure, which to do with a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind is a Sin and Snare. And ſo it is in our preſent caſe. Some ſays, 'tis indubitable, that K. <hi>James</hi> is King <hi>de jure,</hi> and that K. <hi>William</hi> is not King at all; others ſay as indubitably, that K. <hi>James</hi> is not King at all, but K. <hi>William</hi> is King <hi>de jure;</hi> others own K. <hi>William</hi> to be King only <hi>de facto,</hi> and K. <hi>James de jure;</hi> others that are indubitably for his being <hi>de facto,</hi> doubt his being <hi>de jure</hi> King. And a great number through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance confide, or doubt, more, or leſs, in all theſe points, which they cannot reach. Now ſince Practice muſt follow Principles, and rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, how ſhall we ſettle all theſe under one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Communion on that Authors Maxims? There is no poſſible way, but by following the direction of the Convocation Book in Obeying the thorow Settlement of the King <hi>de facto,</hi> made by publick Submiſſion, or continuance, the form of which being a point of Law, not Religion, muſt be determined, and defined by the Suprem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Domeſtick Judgment we have in Civils, which Certainly is that of Parliament, after whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions we need no further Torment our ſelves in vain about Antecendent queſtions, but conſider
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102364:63"/>the Right we have, as well as Duty, to Live quiet under Publick, Formal, and Judicial Settlements, which we are to take as Gods Ordinance for the time being. By which Rule we ſhall ſecure our ſelves from both Extreams, either of owning forcible Entry for Legal Title, or proper Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, or of Aſſerting all Change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be Invalid and unobliging, as Contrary to the Law of God, who, we know, changeth Times, and Seaſons, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and Diſſolves, and Reſettles all the States of Men under proper Laws of Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the Juſt and Unſearchable Counſels of his Will. And now I will only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your Rules of Communion to our Caſe, and ſo diſmiſs this Theorie. If this preſent Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be full, and the Judgment of the Nation herein againſt your Right, then all your Prayers and Execrations againſt the preſent State are Irreligious, Immoral, Polluted, and Abominable, and under an <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Anathema, upon which all Chriſtians muſt abhor your Communion, even without any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Sentence, as being ſelf-condemned, and cut off. And if all theſe Dangers and Snares await us upon every Civil Change, upon Mens Private Croſs Opinions about Right, and Plenitude of Settlement; Chriſtian Religion, Eccleſiaſtical Union could not have continued a Twelve-Month under the Changes of the <hi>Empire</hi> from <hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> but muſt have Expired, before it had been Expoſed to the World. And I deſire the Learned <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> to Suit his Principles, if he can, with the Conditions, and Capacities of Human Life, and after Good endeavours this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102364:63"/>way he will find, that theſe Civil Queſtions are not of Private Determination. But if there be ſuch Dreadful Dangers of Immoral Devotions on ſuch Conteſted Rights of Government, they Naturally ly on them, who in Civil matters Oppoſe their Private Conceptions and Practices to Publick and Judicial Conſtitutions, which is a Courſe in its own Nature formally Seditious, and for that cauſe Un-Chriſtian, and may too truly and ſadly Corrupt their Communion, and Defile their Devotions, who will not know the ways of Peace.</p>

                        <p>In the Murther of a Parent King by his Son and Heir<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. 8.</note> I proved, that the ſin did not Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate the Parricide, but that our Conſtitutions admit him to the Crown, which you not being able to deny, I conclude, that Breach of Gods Commandments Nulls not a Title procured thereby. And then you Aſſign the cauſe hereof, that the Parent, and all his Rights are Extinct by his Death, but King <hi>James</hi>'s Life, and Conteſtation Diverſifies his Caſe. Then I rejoyn, that it is not the Breach of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102364:64"/>that Incapacitates the Princes of this Crown, but the Life, and Contention of King <hi>James.</hi> And is not this an Accurate, and an undeniable Obſervation? For if Breach of Gods Commandments, either alone creates, or with other Cauſes concurs to a Civil Incapacity, then ſuch Breach doth, either partially, or ſolely, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct ſuch capacity. And if ſo, the Murther of a Royal Father muſt be ſome Bar to the Succeſſion of the Parricide: But if it be none at all in that Caſe, why ſhould a leſs Sin againſt God Preclude a Title in another Caſe in Conjunction with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, which yet your ſelves will not dare deny to be alone Encluſive of King <hi>Williams</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? Here then I will ſift you upon this Point. Would the continued being, and Claim of King <hi>James</hi> Incapacitate King <hi>William</hi> of the Royal Title, if King <hi>William</hi> had never broken any Commandment of God, or No? If you ſay, Yea, then the Breach of Gods Commandments Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes nothing to King <hi>Williams</hi> Incapacity, which alone ariſeth by it ſelf from the Life and Claim of King <hi>James,</hi> it being Naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for two Men to be Total and Separate Proprietors of the ſame Right at one time; a truth not at all belonging to Ethic's, or Divinity. If you ſay, No, then you yield, that King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> may be Entitled to King <hi>James's</hi> his Throne without breaking Gods Commandments, even during the permanency of King <hi>James</hi> his Life and Right. And han't you hereby well amended the matter? But ſuch are the reſults of affected Sophiſtries, eſpecially when they are Impertinent alſo. Now that yours are ſo, will be hence Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102364:64"/>For our Queſtion laſt was whether no Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements procured by Breach of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be Submitted to, and particularly ſuch, as follow the Extinction of the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors Tenure, and Title, through ſuch ill means? And now you Anſwer me, that Gods Commandments do Incapacitate King <hi>William</hi> of King <hi>James</hi>'s Crown, becauſe King <hi>James</hi>'s Title is not Extinct, but Lives with him. Which if it had been true, I ſhould alſo have denied King <hi>William</hi> a capacity to the Title, not from the Moral Law, but from Natural and Legal Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. And therefore I ſuppoſe King <hi>James</hi>'s Tenure firſt Extinct, when I ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. p. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>But if His Tenure be Extinct, as it hath been Publickly judged by this Nation, our Oath to him Ceaſes, tho' be contend never ſo much for the Recovery.</hi> And there I take it for neceſſary, that the Judgment of the Nation muſt overballance all your contrary private Opinions as to all our publick Duties and Obligations. Now when your words are diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, they amount to no more than this, that the Law of God forbids one Man to ſeize on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mans Permanent Right, and Title, in which as it is nothing to the Rhombus, ſo you have no adverſary. But this is not your ſecond, or ſingle Failure, but here appears a third point of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for our Queſtion was not, what Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do forbid, but whether the doing what God forbids, in order to the procuring formal Titles, and Tenures in Law, by the real, or Judicial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of another Mans Tenures, does Create a Civil Incapacity or Nullity in the Tenure ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102364:65"/>This is what I deny, and I defie you to Prove. The inſtance of a Royal Heir upon the Murther of his Father is an unmovable Argument for me; for tho' the Laws of God forbid him to procure the Crown that way, yet if he violates thoſe Duties, the Laws of God do not null the Tenure acquired by forbidden Wickedneſs. The Law of God forbad <hi>David</hi> to Uſurp <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah's</hi> wife, while the <hi>Hittite's</hi> Title in her continued with his Life, and the King might actually keep her, but by no Legal form of Tenure. The ſame Law of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the King to Murther <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> with the Sword of the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> in order to a Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Tenure of his wife; Yet when that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was compleated, the Title of the King in <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was Legal, and valid, even by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ratification of God himſelf. Nay, when <hi>Ahab</hi> had ſlain <hi>Naboth</hi> by Judicial Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for falſly imputed Blaſphemy, the form of Title, by which he after enjoyed <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine yard, was Legal by Judicial Forfeiture, tho' it were Morally unjuſt in the ſight of God; for had there been a Civil Nullity therein, it had been neceſſary for him to have compaſſed <hi>Naboths</hi> Death by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Sentence in order to a Civil Title, which <hi>Jezebel</hi> procured for him this way, to avoid the Odium of open, and formal Un-entitled Uſurpation. So that had your Loud Obloquies againſt their Majeſties morals been never ſo true, Yet, King <hi>James</hi>'s Tenure, being Extinct, doth not preclude a Civil Title in their preſent Majeſties, which we are now to abide by, and defend by the greateſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102364:65"/>Suffrage of Gods Laws, Reaſon, and the Laws of Nations; at which expreſſion I have heard, that your Friend <hi>T. B.</hi> winds up his Mouth, and<note n="*" place="margin">T. B's <hi>2d.</hi> Lett. p. 26.</note>

                           </note> 
                           <hi>that the Oath expreſſes no form of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation concerning Right. But what if it doth not, as long as it expreſſes what manifeſtly includes Right? And this Allegiance directly, and manifeſtly doth. For it is the proper duty of a Subject to his Lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and contains an Obligation to the Performance of all thoſe Acts, which are required from every Subject, as he ſtands Related to his Rightful Sovereign; It is the immediate Reſult of that Relation, So that where you deny your Allegiance due, you in conſequence deny the Right of the Prince; where you Pay your Allegiance, it is as owning him to be your Prince. And therefore when you ſwear Allegiance, you Tacitly ſwear a Right. For tho' there is a ſort of Obedience, or Obſervances which may be paid to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, Robbers, and Pirates, yet Allegience may not be paid to them, as being the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural duty of the Subject, which The Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions have Appropriated to their Legal Prince, and made Inſeparable from him; And now I hope you will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102364:66"/>not tell us, that the Oath doth not expreſs Allegiance.</hi> T. B's. 2d. Let. p. 26.</p>

                        <p>The giddy ramblings in your forms of expreſſion Create in me a juſt ſuſpition of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Ignorance, or Inſincerity, or both. For Firſt you Confound the Terms Lawful and Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as <hi>Synonymous,</hi> even thereby to equivocate. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>You ſay,</hi> that Allegiance manifeſtly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Right; and yet that he that ſwears Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, doth but Tacitly ſwear that Right, that is manifeſtly Included in Allegiance. But if we manifeſtly ſwear a manifeſt Allegiance, it is manifeſt that we manifeſtly (not Tacitly) ſwear all that is manifeſtly Included in it. But if we do Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly ſwear the Right, then is that Right but Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly Included, and prehaps ſo Tacitly, that the Swearers themſelves do not perceive it. But as to the diſtinction between Lawful and Rightful, I have but juſt now explained it at Large, and<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sol &amp; Ab. p. 7.</hi> The Actual Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord who is viſibly Legal tho' not Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Rightful.</note> offered it to you in our firſt Conference; which makes your Neglect of its Obſervation ſo much the more Diſingenuous, and Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, as proceeding from a deſign to Enſnare.</p>
                        <p>So again you Prevaricate when <hi>You ſay, Where I deny Allegiance due, I in conſequence deny the Right of the Prince.</hi> For there may be two ſorts of Right, immediate and mediate; the former without, the latter upon an intermediate and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102364:66"/>qualifying Condition. Again, an immediate Right to a Crown to be enjoyed, muſt be diſtinguiſhed from an immediate Right to Allegiance founded in the actual poſſeſſion of the Crown. Now he, that hath a juſt immediate Right to a Crown not poſſeſſed, hath no immediate Right to my Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and no more at the moſt can be aſſigned him than this, that he, having a real Right to the unenjoyed Crown, hath a real, but mediate Right to the Allegiance on the condition of Poſſeſſion, for want of which he cannot as yet claim the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance of the Subject; for whatſoever materials Right he has, the legal Title to Allegiance conſiſts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the legal State and Forms of Poſſeſſion. Wherefore I do not deny alwaies a real Right to a Crown, where I deny may Allegiance legally and immediately due; for this denial of Allegiance ſo due, denies only a formal Title thereto, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a legal actual Settlement in the Sovereignty; except I declare, that the Reaſon, why I deny a Prince Allegiance due, is, becauſe he in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has no juſt and real Right to the Crown he has; but then that Reaſon is my own private, not the publick Reaſon of the Law, or of legal denial of Allegiance due, which is the want of legal Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. So when you go on, and ſay, <q>where you pay your Allegiance, it is owning him to be your Prince;</q> 'Tis true indeed, it is always own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be my Prince formally Legal, but not alwaies Morally and Honeſtly Rightful. So that it is not in your Senſe alwaies true, that when we Swear Allegiance, we tacitly Swear a Right. But I doubt, here you forgot the dubitable Caſe of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Reigns, to which the Nation oft, and long Swore Allegiance, and to which you have given great allowances. But did they all Swear the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102364:67"/>Lineal Right of that Houſe to that Crown, which it enjoyed? Or was not ſuch a Senſe of the Oath perjurious? And if it be ſo, will you vouchſafe it your great and gracious allowances, and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? You have need here of a new Rubbing-bruſh to cleanſe your Senſes, and clear up your Memory.</p>

Which if it be ſo hard for you to apprehend, I will put it into this fair Syllogiſm; The Senſe of the King and Parliament (the Impoſers of the Oath) is, that King</hi> William <hi>is King</hi> de Jure; <hi>But we muſt take the Oath in the Senſe of the Impoſers;</hi> Ergo, <hi>we muſt take the Oath in this Senſe, that King</hi> William <hi>is King</hi> de Jure. <hi>Do you think, that King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary <hi>did intend, that you ſhould eſteem them as a King and Queen, that had no Right? If not, then all are perjur'd, who Swear to them only as King and Queen</hi> de facto, (i.e. <hi>all, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Rule of Swearing according to the Intention of the Impoſers.) For the Oath was chiefly made for the ſatisfaction of King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary; <hi>and they were the Supream, at leaſt the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102364:67"/>chief part of the Impoſers; but if they were only a part, (as none deny them to be in an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) then their Senſe is included in the Senſe of the Impoſers, and conſequently we muſt take the Oath in their Senſe, or not take it according to the Senſe of the Impoſers.</hi> M. S. Reflex. <hi>Or did your Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, or thoſe that followed them, intend to bind you to any thing? If they intended to bind you to nothing, they laid their wiſe Heads together to ſuch a purpoſe, as never yet any Men did. But if they did intend to bind you to your New Governours in any thing, what can that reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be, other than what they admitted them in? And that, you ſay, was in their Lawful Right. They were indeed aſhamed at that time to put it into the body of the Oath; and beſides, they knew it would have made many Perſons abhor it; but it is plain, this they deſigned, and tricked upon you. Hence you may perceive, that your ſlippery Remark will not deliver you from the Intention of the Impoſer.</hi> T. B. Sec. Lett. pag. 27.</p>

                        <p>This Diſcourſe is ſo involved, and you talk of an Impoſer ſo like an Impoſer, that it is ſomewhat difficult to trace out your Senſe. Yet this I will endeavour, and if I can be lucky, I will give you my Senſe of it. Here then we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Intentions, firſt, of the Conſtituting Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or Convention; ſecondly, of the Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Parliament; and thirdly, of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, in the Impoſition of the Oath. Firſt then,<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. <hi>pag.</hi> 9.</note> I acknowledged, that <hi>the Conſtituting (as well as enſuing) Parliament did judge it in their Lawful Right,</hi> rebus ſic ſtantibus, <hi>to admit King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary. And ſo they always judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:102364:68"/>that they for their part, act Lawfully and of Right, when they admit only a King <hi>de facto,</hi> either when unlawfully forced, or otherwiſe neceſſitated thereunto, by inſuperable Exigencies. And ſo Men may Honeſtly for their part, contract faithful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Piratick Maſters to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tho' unlawfully brought into that Neceſſity. This being done by the firſt Parliament, and that in their Judgment on their part lawfully, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they conſider for an Oath of Allegiance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſual upon ſuch new Conſtitutions. And hereupon a Motion was made for an Aſſertion of Right to be inſerted into the Oath, but it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. This muſt therefore in legal conſtruction evince, that their intention in the Enacted Oath, did not imply an Aſſertion of Right. For, tho' you can, according to the Temper you are of, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probriouſly tax the Wiſdom and Gravity of that Great Aſſembly, yet we are obliged only to an open and ſincere Intention, not a tricked one, eſpecially that, which you would trick upon them, and us too, that you might blacken and reproach our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; tho' yet how we could be tricked out of our Senſes, if Allegiance manifeſtly includes Right, as you ſay, I cannot divine. However, herein are two points of Right obſervable, one in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties taking the Crown, and another, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, in the admiſſion of them thereto. And in both theſe, they obliged us to Swear no Aſſertion, but only, as<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. <hi>pag.</hi> 9.</note> I told you, <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that Allegiance due by our Laws to Kings thus actually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without any other charge</hi> upon us to Swear the Juſtice and Rectitude of their Proceedings, of which there is no competent or ſuperiour Judge, or Witneſs, but God. Secondly,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102364:68"/>After the Conſtituting, comes the Recognizing Parliament, who added a Declaration of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Right, in taking and poſſeſſing the Crown, as well as of the Rectitude of <hi>our</hi> Admiſſion; for this makes up the Title <hi>de Jure</hi> in their Majeſties. This might be the mental intention of the firſt Parliament, but it was not by them promulgate, or recognized, which omiſſion was therefore ſupplied by the ſecond Parliament. But notwithſtanding this Recognition of Right, they neither added, nor altered any thing as to the Oath, but that ſtill ſtood, and yet ſtands in its firſt Intention, which it received wholly and ſolely from the firſt Parliament. So that the firſt Parliament diſcharging us from an Aſſertion of Right, in their and their Majeſties Proceedings and Settlement in that Oath, and the ſecond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament doing nothing to the Oath, it does not by its Recognition charge us to Swear more, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the firſt had done. So that all the Right, that can fairly be ſuppoſed, owned, and imported, in taking and impoſing that Oath, is, that private Subjects have a Right to Swear, and pay that Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, which the Eſtates have thus fixed: And here alſo we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Judgments, and Acts of Parliaments in all thoſe Parts, Points, and Articles, which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Swears nothing to, and thoſe particular words, or points, which are directly ſet in the Oath, and ſo propoſed to common Obſervation. For the former only oblige the Conſcience of the Subject to exteriour and civil Duties, without involving any interiour Cenſure, or Senſe, upon the Moral Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and Conſcience of our Maſters. But an Oath, aſſerting the Moral Juſtice of Humane Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Procedures, is a dangerous ſnare in all Caſes above a Man's underſtanding, liable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102364:69"/>doubt, or queſtion, as all publick Politicks generally are, eſpecially with the Vulgar. And if a Man may be allowed with Modeſty to gueſs at the Piety of his Superiours, it ſeems it is ſuch a ſnare, as the Parliament never intended to lay for themſelves, and therefore not for us, for whom they muſt have began the Example. For 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to believe, that moſt of the Members, that really were of, and for the Opinion <hi>de Jure,</hi> as well on their Majeſties Meaſures, as their own in this Settlement, would not willingly have Sworn that Right abſolutely, tho' they would have Sworn their belief of it. For Matters of Fact, of which alone, we can be certainly conſcious, either by our outer, or inner Senſes, are the only proper Matter of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and eſpecially legal Depoſitions. But Points of Law and Right, concerning Matters of Fact, are more remote from that evidence and clearneſs of Senſe and Perception, than to be given upon Oath; and are delivered by Courts as Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Opinions only, that paſs into a Civil Effect, tho' the Judges (if put to it) would not always (not any time willingly) Swear the Infallibility of ſuch Judgments, eſpecially the doubtful, or diſſenting Judges, againſt their own private and perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. Thus then in Parliament the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact appeared evident enough to the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but the Points of Law, ariſing upon the Facts, underwent much and long diſcuſſion, upon which at laſt the Judgment for Abdication, and an actual vacancy paſſed; ſo that in their Opinion they for their part, might in that State of Affairs, proceed to this Settlement, and upon theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they acted, as taking them for True, Legal, and Right. Yet, conſidering that moſt of both Houſes were not Lawyers, it is not imaginable,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102364:69"/>that they could willingly have Sworn the certain and abſolute Rectitude of theſe Opinions, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they, who were of contrary Sentiments, but over-ruled by the majority. And hence the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right was rejected from the Oath. And I wiſh all Projectors of Oaths in points of Law, Title, and matters without our reach or power, would follow, and reverence the Exemplary Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Tenderneſs of our Parliaments herein, that no tricks, nor traps may be laid for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in a State, and Age, in which we have given them ſo profuſe a liberty. But to return from this Progreſſion; the alteration from the old, or laſt Form, made in this Oath by the deſigned omiſſion of aſſerted Right, argues an intentional diſcharge of that difficulty, or doubt, in this preſent Oath, which has nothing in it Teſtimonially affirmative of other Mens Morals, but only promiſſory of each Man's legal Subjection, which implies no poſitive Aſſent to the Moral Juſtice of the Conſtitution. For Allegiance is not only perſonal, but local alſo, due in great meaſure, as well from Foreign Sojourners, as from Natives, and what may be as well required upon Oath of Strangers during there abode here, who yet however, are not engaged to maintain the real Rectitude of our Eſtabliſhments. And tho' a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Allegiance be a cloſer, and more perpetual Tie to ſeveral eſpecial Offices and Duties, yet while the Form of its Engagement is purely promiſſory, it obliges us to look back to no further dark Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, than the legal Forms of actual Settlement, and Recognition. So Sheriffs by their Oath, are obliged to Execute Royal and Judicial Orders and Decrees of State, and Courts in legal Forms directed to them, yet do they not Swear the Rectitude of all ſuch Mandates, or Judgments, (which they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102364:70"/>Swear to Execute) tho' declared right by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Authorities. So a Tenant, Swearing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Fealty to a new Landlord obtaining by Law, doth not aſſert the reality of his Right, tho' the Jury in Verdict Swear it to be his in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Judges give Judgment accordingly upon ſworn Engagements to Juſtice. For the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may juſtly ſuſpect the Errors or Injuſtice of the Proceſs, even while he Swears the Fealty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Oath is not concerned in, or depends on the Original Merits of the Cauſe, but the legal Forms of Judicial Aſſignation. But if you will take Rightful and Lawful, for meer Civil and Regular forms of Introduction, I will grant you, that an Oath of Native Allegiance, imports an acknowledgment of ſuch a kind of Rightful and Lawful Settlement, and Form of Title. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Diſcourſe, ſince Intentions do not explain the words they utter, but words intentions; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in obliging and legal Formularies of Contracts, we are obliged to no more by them, than their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words do openly propoſe to our apprehenſions, and ſo paſs all Judgments in Law, upon Pleas of Contract, according to this Rule of expounding Words, Oral, or Written, in Bargains, Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Covenants. If then a Recognition, or Aſſertion of Right, be not expreſly tendred in the very words of the Oath, or jointly with it, by ſome determinate Rule of Explication, we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in ſuch Oath, to ſuch an Aſſertion, much leſs, if ſuch Aſſertion be openly excluded from the Oath, to prevent ſuſpicion. But let us ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Aſſertion of Right, ſo manifeſtly precluded, be yet tricked into the Oath by any ſurreptitious Implication: Now if it be ſo, it muſt be involved, either in the Stile of King and Queen, or in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102364:70"/>Terms of Faith and Allegiance; but neither can be juſtly pleaded, ſince the known Judicial diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> ſhews the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be in common given both to thoſe, who come in without any violation of our Laws, and ſo are in Right, and to others, who have injuriouſly got, without any antecedent legal Capacity, into the legal Forms of Settlement, and ſo are in Fact only Kings. And true Faith and Allegiance, is by our Laws always given in the ſame, or like promiſſory Forms of Oath to the meer Kings in Fact, as well as others: But this is not all; I will further <hi>ex abundanti</hi> ſhew you, that this cloſeneſs to the meer Senſe of expreſs words, is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative Rule of obligation in Oaths, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, not only by the Laws and Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in common, but is particularly juſtified by precedents in the Divine Hiſtory on the ſacred Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's own People. The Caſe I refer to, is mentioned, <hi>Judges</hi> 21. There the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Mizpeth</hi> make this Oath, <hi>There is not any of us ſhall give his Daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</hi> Here by the word <hi>Us,</hi> they intend all the People beſide the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> as preſuming all the reſt engaged there againſt <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and really intending that <hi>Benjamin</hi> henceforth, ſhould never have one Wife from among the reſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> After this, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that the Men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead,</hi> had not concurred in that Expedition, and therefore they deſtroyed all the <hi>Jabeſites,</hi> except the Virgins, and theſe they gave for Wives, to <hi>Benjamin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their real Intention in the making that Oath. Now what ſhall be ſaid hereupon? Did they violate the Oath of God, or take upon them in their <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> to diſpenſe with it on a reſerved Right of the Impoſers? No, there was yet no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102364:71"/>nor ſuch diſpenſing Power under that Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. For it appears by their Care in a ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that they were very tenderly ſenſible of their indiſſoluble obligation by the Oath, nor does the Scripture Cenſure them for any ſuch prevarication. How ſhall we then untie this Knot? Thus, whereas they had ſworn <hi>None of us,</hi> it was literally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretable to a valid Obligation on thoſe only, (and their Daughters) who were actually preſent, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in that War; ſo that the <hi>Jabeſites,</hi> tho' at firſt compriſed in the general deſign and intention, on preſumption of their Concurrence, yet in fact not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged, were eaſily judged not actually includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Oath, as not really being within the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs term of the <hi>Us in Mizp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>h.</hi> Moreover the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſites</hi> did not give their own Daughters, as being all before <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> the Elders gave them; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they, that gave them, gave not their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Daughters; and they were given, tho not as the Daughters of mere Heathens, yet as Daughters of Men aliened by the publick Anathema and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from God's People, and ſo not of the <hi>Us,</hi> collectively taken for the united Community or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thus not all inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had in the conception of this Oath did oblige, but only what the Words thereof did expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. Again, when this Expedient was found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for the ſurviving <hi>Benjamites,</hi> a further Conſultation ariſes in the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> how to furniſh them with Wives conſiſtently with their Oath. And at length they find this lawful Evaſion from, and contrary to their firſt intention. They direct the <hi>Benjamites</hi> to ſurprize their Daughters in the Dances of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and promiſe to pacifie the Parents and Kindred of the ſurprized Damoſels. And herein they judged themſelves free from Perjury, becauſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102364:71"/>the natural Parents did not give their reſpective Daughters, nor did the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> manually deliver them as the Daughters of the People, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, directed, conſented to, and after confirmed the Surprize. Which ſhews, that in the ſenſe of that ſacred Court, Oaths do not tie the Conſcience beyond the neceſſary Senſe of the Words, tho' more be actually intended by the Perſons inſtituting, and taking the Oath in their firſt Conception. And then the Rule holds much more clear, when the Swearer intends no more than the words ſimply ſignifie, and is directed by the very Impoſers to uſe that freedom, and diſcharged from all other collateral, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential Conſtructions as we are by the rejection of the Propoſals for an Aſſertion of Right. But I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that all this procedure of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or my Accounts of it, will paſs with you for pretty jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, who are ſo dextrous and hardy to reproach whole Nations, as if you had been another <hi>Elias;</hi> tho' herein I would adviſe you to premit your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to your Cenſure. In the Interim we will in the third place aſcend to their Majeſties intention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Of which I ſhall in general ſay, that no Man can evince, that they intended any more in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Oath than the Eſtates; but if they did, thoſe perſonal intentions came not into the Act, or Oath, and ſo can be of no publick cogniſance, or obligation, the Oath being made to ſatisfie their Majeſties intentions indeed, as far as they were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with the intention of the Eſtates, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or otherwiſe. And the Eſtates did indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſatisfy their Majeſties as far as juſtly they could without crucifying the Conſcience of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which could contribute nothing to the intereſt of their Majeſties, nor to the Honour of their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Clemency. So that the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102364:72"/>is, whether the joint and complex intention of their Majeſties, and the Parliament in the Oath was, <hi>That we ſhould judge them to be a King and Queen that had no Right?</hi> And here I anſwer, that they never intended, that we ſhould deny the Right of their Title in Thought, Word, or Deed. Nay, I add, that in the Recognition they deſigned to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an Opinion, and Belief in us of their Majeſties Right, as far as the publick Judgment of a Nation can morally conduce thereunto; and alſo to ſilence all Tongues, and Pens to the contrary; but of what they gently willed Men to believe, they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to require a peremptory Oath, thro' their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Tenderneſs for liberty of Conſcience. Now the intention we are upon, by the good leave of the Syllogiſm, is not the inclining will to perſwade us to a Belief, nor the authoritative will of ſilencing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, but that will which impoſes the Oath, <hi>i. e.</hi> what they willed, and intended peremptorily to be ſworn? And this does not import ſo much as an aſſent, or Belief, much leſs an abſolute aſſertion <hi>de Jure,</hi> tho' King <hi>William</hi> is <hi>de Jure</hi> in the publick Judgment of the Nation. And what ground have you to fancy that this is not ſatisfactory to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties? Their Right is publickly recognized, a full Allegiance of the Subject upon Oath given, with ſufficient Laws for the Coercion of Recuſants, and all that is neceſſary to ſecure them in the Throne; and can you dare to ſay, they are not hereby ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe every Man is not bound to ſwear the <hi>Jus,</hi> which many feeble Senſes may not underſtand? I hope you never heard of any Complaint made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by their Majeſties, and if not, 'tis a bold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Suggeſtion to object, or ſurmiſe it; but the moſt frontleſs rudeneſs of all is, to ſay, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Tricked, and open Nonſenſe to aſſert this
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102364:72"/>of a project of concealing an intention of Right, in words, which you ſay manifeſtly include it.</p>

                        <p>No doubt both Parliaments had the ſame intention; and the Recognition was but a fuller De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Senſe of the former Parliament in the Conſtitution. And for ſuch Bodies to enſnare us to a Belief of K. <hi>William</hi>'s Right, while we are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Oaths to him, is, if not to command, yet to inſinuate Perjury; ſince they, that are hereby trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that Opinion, intend the aſſertion of it in the Oath; and the Opinion of Right being the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine, the publick taking of the Oath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſs Denial of the Right, doth either real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſeemingly, at leaſt import an Aſſertion of Right, and ſo gives a juſt Scandal to all Men of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, as looking like an Exemplary conſent to, and Profeſſion of the Right, and is as Exemplary a Snare to the Conſciences of the Ignorant.<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>To humour you for once, let us ſuppoſe, that K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> had violated the Laws of Succeſſion, and ſo were not every way <hi>de Jure</hi> Sovereign; yet the Aſſertion of Right being reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the framing of the Oath, a little Care will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all prejudices in our ſelves, and others, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that we ſwear no more than was expreſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the form of the Oath, with an explicit exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Aſſertion of Right; and that other points, and Acts conſequent fall not under our intention, by the will of the impoſers againſt their Will. But 'tis
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102364:73"/>in truth a bold thing, but like you, to take it for evident, that their Majeſties have broken the Laws of Succeſſion, when the whole Kingdom hath judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally determined otherwiſe. 'Tis indeed poſſible for a publick Opinion to be Erroneous, and a private one on the contrary true; yet nothing but an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable (as it were Meridian) Evidence muſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally confront a publick Opinion againſt its Civil efficacy, which I ſuppoſe you have not gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Civil Judgment <hi>de Jure.</hi> I will not here proceed on ſuch Originals of Royal Title, as will juſtifie Changes of Kings every day; I will not caſt in my Lot, nor mix my Counſels with thoſe ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, who by cajoling the Subjects into falſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aims of Power, cokes them thereby into endleſs Ruins and Commotions. I will only follow the good, Ancient, and conſtant Rules of Order, Peace and Righteouſneſs, which alone can make us an happy People, and Advocate for their Majeſties Innocency toward theſe. The ordinary Rule of Succeſſion I ſtill grant you to be Lineal, or properly Hereditary; ſo that if a Prince's Tenure be extinct by Death, or otherwiſe, the next Heir of ordinary Courſe ſhould ſucceed. But if a Queſtion ariſe upon the Tenure, whether permanent, or ceſſant in a ſtate of Anarchy and actual vacancy in the Throne, or who is the next Heir, this is moſt properly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by the Eſtates of the Kingdom, as being our Maſters and Truſtees, to oblige, and direct our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance. Here then they judged King <hi>James</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure ceſſant by a virtual Abdication, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Orange</hi> the next Heir. But conſidering the then ſtate of Affairs, they judged it abſolutely lawful and neceſſary for the time being, with the ſmooth conceſſion of the two next Heirs apparent, to inveſt the Order during the Prince's Life. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102364:73"/>changed but not violated, and a temporary Change in the Courſe was admitted to ſecure the true Deſcent in a juſt Line for ever, as appears by the ſettled and determined Series of Succeſſors.</p>

                        <p>Very well; I ſee you and your Eſtates make nothing of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> But your Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had before not only aſſaulted our Law, but overturned the Government, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign too; and can you ſay, that he violated not our Laws in his way to the Crown?</p>

                        <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being no Subject of <hi>England,</hi> the proceſs of his Expedition was in him no violation of Duty by him owing to our Laws, which is the only form of Guilt that could have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted his Right. If then he cannot be charged with the breach of Civil Duties incumbent on him, he is not incapacitated of Rights by any paſſages in that Expedition. But moreover he came to preſerve our Laws and Forms, Liberties, and Religion, when they were all in a fervent Courſe of ſubverſion. And therefore, tho' during his Marches, the Execution of the Laws for the time being was interrupted in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes, and Military Officers were by him conſtituted in the Countries, thro' which he paſſed, all this was neceſſary, as methods of Medicine for the time to recover the diſeaſed ſtate of the Patient, to the Antient vigour of its Laws, and ſoundneſs of Conſtitution. But when King <hi>James</hi> left the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Nation unhealed, the Prince left all to be legally Cured, and firmly ſetled to the great Council of the Land; that ſo no Man might have a Colour for Complaint; that he affected our Conqueſt, Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage, or Suppreſſion in our Civil Rights by any Arbitrary Power. For which great Service they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102364:74"/>found out a fair way, without Violence to any ones Right, to gratify, and honour him with the Crown, or rather to ſecure all we had by ſuch a Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If then the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was no Subject, nor Enemy to the Nation, but Friend, and Patron to us, and our Laws, how can he be charged with an injurious violation of them? And her preſent Majeſty, tho' more obliged to her Husband than her Father by the ties of Nature, being a Native of <hi>England</hi> (and ſo the King's Subject in this Land) never appeared here to diſturb her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or break her Native Allegiance. But when her Father had fled out of the Kingdom from before her Husband, as not daring to abide a Parliamentary diſcuſſion of their Cauſes, and the Eſtates of the Nation determined to ſettle her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with her Husband in this Sovereignty, ſhe, being thereupon ſent to, comes over, and accepts that Settlement, which the Nation thought ſo juſt and neceſſary, and to which (as ſuch) the Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi> conceded without any Remonſtrance. So that neither can her preſent Majeſty, be charged with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny breach of our Conſtitutions herein, which might obſtruct her Civil Title of being Queen <hi>de Jure,</hi> upon the Ceſſion of her Father, and her next Place in the Succeſſion. Which is I think ſo fair a Plea for the Recognition <hi>de Jure,</hi> that if it cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate all prejudices to the contrary in all Perſons, yet is a juſt Reaſon to inhibit Contradictions in private Men, who have very little Authority to Cenſure Publick Counſels and Determinations. But tho' we have thus defended the Title <hi>de Jure,</hi> yet, as I ſaid before, we were not obliged to Swear it. Nor did I ever hear of any Courts, that loaded the Oath with ſuch an Aſſertion of Right, when their directive Judgments were required thereupon.</p>

                           <hi>That if they took not the Oath as the Parliament intended, they took it as directed by their Majeſties Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.

                        <p>One would think by this clamour, that I had laid Gun-powder for the ruin of the whole World, to which however I dare appeal for my Innocency. Firſt then, if the Senſe of the Impoſer be in all Caſes uncapable of ambiguity with even the meaneſt, or unskilled People, then I confeſs my
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102364:76"/>ſelf on the wrong ſide of the Hedge. But you were beſt have a care of aſſerting this, leſt you draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you the general Cry of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> If then ſome words in any enacted Formulary happen to become ambiguous to particular private Subjects, which are clear enough in themſelves, to Men of Judgment in ſuch matters, muſt the inferiour Court, where theſe Forms are adminiſtred, reſolve the Senſe of the Law upon Queſtions therein moved, or no? If not, they are no Court of Juſtice to direct the Subject in his Civil Duties, Rights or Obligations. If it muſt determine ſuch Queſtions, then that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution muſt paſs for Law to all Civil Effects upon that particular Caſe, 'till reverſed. But whereas all Courts are ſubject to a poſſibility of Error, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the Caſe is rare, or intricate, or the Courts through haſte or heedleſneſs, take not the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſufficient Conſideration, if ſuch miſtake judicially paſs, yet is it formally valid in Law. But ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes rarely happen, and the ambiguities of formed Words in ſhort Oaths, Contracts, or Declarations cannot be many, or manifold, except we fancy them made on purpoſe to puzzle our Faculties, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences both together. And now I would fain have you produce any ſuch ſhort Oath liable to your thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand wrong Senſes. In our Oath the only Queſtion is, what it is to bear true Faith and Allegiance? This Courts generally interpret faithful performance of all thoſe Duties, which the Laws of our Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on require to our actual Sovereigns, the particulars of which are determined by our Common, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Laws. Now to exerciſe your Skill, I pray make a brisk Eſſay of fixing one half thouſand Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe words alien from this Explication, which has been given by ſeveral Courts. Or if your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage lowers herein, I pray ſhew this very interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102364:76"/>to be either inſidious, or erroneous. But whereas you think the Errors of Inferiour Courts may vacate all Contracts, and Authorities; I had provided an <hi>Atlas</hi> to ſupport them againſt this Ruin, had you thought it conſiderable, when I offer'd you this Maxim,<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sol.</hi> &amp; <hi>Ab</hi> pag. 10.</note> that in ſuch emergent Caſes, <hi>What ſuch particular Courts determin, muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Law 'till condemned by a Superiour Court, or nulled by the Legiſlative, which will ſecure our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers from the Ridicule, and leave that Character to its own Proprietors.</hi> As diſmal a Speculation is that, which you raiſe about Courts, and Swearers Clubbing together to elude the Oath, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this importance, <hi>viz.</hi> If a Knave ask a whole Court of Knaves, to play the Knave, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Oath, and the authoriz'd Knaves have no more Wit, nor Honeſty but to do ſo, then the ſuborning or Conſulting Knave, finding their Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Knavery, muſt be converted to Honeſt of a ſudden, and take no advantage of their Knavery, but tell them they are arrant Knaves, ay, that they are. For ſuch I dare ſwear is the Judicial Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Myſtery. But a plain unintriguing Head would have thought, that I had ſpoken of Honeſt Men of tender Conſcience, conſulting the Senſe of Courts, from the juſt Information and Direction thereof, upon their doubts concerning the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Oath. And as ſuch a Man would uſe no Arts to Corrupt a Court, ſo could he not eaſily conceive their Opinion fallacious. And after all, if he judged it good, he would approve it, if naught, reject it; if probable, accept it as legal: But if a Man knew the Senſe before, he had no need to try, or tempt the Judgment of a Court, nor ought he to follow it into Immorality, if he knows it falſe. And
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102364:77"/>I ſurely never told you, that a Man, conſcious of Errour, or Prevarication in a Court, might have an Advantage to elude, but in doubtful Senſes to follow that, which the Court has given to honeſt and innocent purpoſes. And all my<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sol. &amp; Ab. pag. pag. 9, 10.</hi> Several Courts have given, and admitted ſuch Senſes, as the moſt tender Recuſant might have ſworn to. What prevarication is there in theſe tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that Religiouſly took care to have an innocent Senſe authoritatively admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, on which and no others they would take the Oath? If theſe Men had made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in the Oath they took, Inſincerity might have been juſtly chargeable on them. If their Majeſties by their Courts declared their Senſe, in paſſing the Act, in favour to all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and tender Conſciences, I hope it was no inſincerity to accept that lenity and Eaſe.</note> Diſcourſe ran up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuppoſed tenderneſs and innocency of the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in ſuch Conſultations. Next I took care alſo for the Innocency and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ibid.</hi> Whether Courts prevaricate in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or no, private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot judge to any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil effect, or Obligation.</note> the Courts too, againſt all Calumnies upon their Judgments in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes given. And yet all this was purpoſely over-look't by you, that ſo you might revile the innocent tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, and Courts, with the imputations of Fraud and Villany. And yet after all this Rant, you your ſelf ſeem to grant, that Men might admit a probable Interpretation, when you ſay, <hi>If the Court give a lower and more eaſier Senſe of the Oaths, than could reaſonably be thought was intended by the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, you ought not to catch at that for an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi> So then what Interpretation the Swearer thinks reaſonably given, he may Swear to, if the Subject matter of the Oath ſo interpreted to him, ſeem lawful. Nay, if a Man doubts the exactneſs of an Interpretation, may he not tell the Court his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102364:77"/>of their Error, but let them know that ſince their Opinion is authentick, and the Oath which they accept for their Majeſties, under that Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, contracts no Evil, he thereupon takes in their Senſe, as judicially Legal and no other? This I think is no Cozening of the State in the Swearer, but a fair ſincerity before God, and the World, and anſwerable at any Tribunal whatſoever. Have you any thing more to ſay upon this Point?</p>

                        <p>I was willing to have ſaved you, if it had been poſſible, out of Error, that ſo I might have kept you out of Danger. But if there be no ſuch Danger, I am very glad of it. What King <hi>James</hi> will do I am no Arbiter, nor did I ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon me to diſcover his Intentions. I only minded you what by our Laws he may do, if you are guilty of Treaſon againſt Allegiance required by our Laws to the preſent Sovereign. But you, according to the ſincerity of a Zealot, repeat me to have ſaid, that King <hi>James</hi> may hang you for not taking the preſent Oath, that I may ſtir up the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Mobb to do ſo preſently. But I thank God for your ſake, that tho' the Laws are ſevere upon unhappy Clergy-Men, that cannot conform to the Oath, yet ſuch Recuſancy does not by any Law make Men Traitors, as not being made Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If you live otherwiſe quietly, and contrive no Seditions, neither I, nor the Laws can touch your Lives, either now, or hereafter in any Revolution. But if you will incur Treaſon againſt extralineal Kings, the Law ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh may be in force againſt you, under the recover'd Reign of the Lineal, however they ſtood in the Days of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Sixth.

Only I think fit here to relate the yet unpubliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe of a moſt judicious and excellent Perſon, ſent me before any Prints appeared on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. His words are theſe; <hi>What I principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on is, That our Law requires Subjection, and Obedience to the Powers in being. To prove this, I ſhall here ſet down the words of Sir</hi> Edward Coke, <hi>and in the Margin note the Authorities to which he refers. Sir</hi> Edward Coke, <hi>ſpeaking of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the</hi> 25th <hi>of</hi> Edward <hi>the Third concerning Treaſon,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that this Statute is to be underſtood of a King in Poſſeſſion of the Crown and Kingdom.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Vid. 11. Hen. 7. c. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>For if there be a King Regnant in poſſeſſion, altho' he be</hi> Rex de Facto, &amp; non de Jure, <hi>yet is he</hi> Seignior le Roy,<note place="margin">4 Edw. 4.1 Inſtit. part. 3. fol. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>within the Purview of this Statute. And the other, that hath Right, and is out of Poſſeſſion, is not within
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102364:80"/>this Act. Nay, if Treaſon be committed againſt a King</hi> de Facto, &amp; non de Jure, <hi>and after the King</hi> de Jure <hi>cometh to the Crown, he ſhall puniſh the Treaſon done to the King</hi> de Facto; <hi>and a Pardon granted by a King</hi> de Jure, <hi>that is not alſo</hi> de Facto (mark this, for it concerns the Nation againſt wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Declarations) <hi>is void.</hi> So to the ſame effect, Judge <hi>Hales</hi> his Pleas of the Crown. pag. 11. <hi>This Argument</hi> (ſaith my invaluable Friend) <hi>I take to be of great force; becauſe the meaſures of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection are not the ſame in all Countreys, but muſt be taken from the Laws and Cuſtoms of every Countrey.</hi> Thus he. And if you will impartially reflect upon your own Words, in which you blame me for inferring, that King <hi>James,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, may puniſh Men for breaking Allegiance to King <hi>William,</hi> theſe words concede it. For if you admit unto me a breach of Allegiance in facts committed againſt King <hi>William,</hi> you then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe an Obligation for Allegiance to him ſo broken; and to break a Duty is puniſhable by the penal Sanction, or virtue of that Law that makes it a Duty; and therefore if not puniſhed, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned before the return of the King <hi>de Jure,</hi> he may puniſh it as a Crime againſt his Laws. And your taking the inſtance of the <hi>Oliverian</hi> Common-wealth to this your conceſſion, impudently admits Allegiance due thereunto, and makes the Oppoſers thereof Traitors, and Legally puniſhable by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second for High Treaſon. But in Truth, no Laws had engaged Allegiance to <hi>O. C.,</hi> or his Common-wealth, as they have to Kings <hi>de facto.</hi> And moreover if the Eſtates themſelves in free and (at that time, and caſe extraordinary) legal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon the antecedent Expiration, and in utter Renunciation of that Common-wealth, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102364:80"/>all other Forms of Democracy recalled him, it had been Treaſon to have oppoſed, and Loyalty to have concurred in that their Reſtitution. But I ſtated the Caſe of <hi>O. C.</hi> ſo clearly in our laſt Conference, that I fancy it beyond the power of <hi>T. B.</hi> himſelf, as ſpiteful as he is, to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel the Tenure of <hi>O. C.</hi> with that of King <hi>William,</hi> whatſoever he may without Argument rant and rave to the contrary. As for the Reproach of ſtirring up the Powers, or the Mob againſt you, I reply, that you prevent me in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue your ſelves; and I will give you any Form of Security, either Sacred, or Secular, upon Soul, or Body, or Goods, that I will never provoke them againſt you, as much as your ſelves have done, and ſtill, for ought I ſee, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to do.</p>

                        <p>I took my ſelf for a Conjurer, nor will I endeavour to enchant you with words inſtead of things, ſince your Temper will not hearken to the voice of the Charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely. And therefore without troubling the Peace of that great Duke, you may pleaſe to remember, that there is an old, received, and approved diſtinction between the Titles, and Characters of King, and Tyrant. The former, is he that Reigns accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws, and Forms of Civil Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his Character, and Authority, is Grateful, and Honourable. The latter, Rules by meer force, oppreſſion, and bondage, without any Civil Form of Tenure, or Settlement, by a power only potential, not poteſtative, and therefore without a proper Authority. And this Character is in moſt eſpecial manner given to Uſurping Rebels, as well as to Foreign Invaders; to deſtroy which Tyrants, the Univerſal Senſe of Nations ever judged it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe they have no Form of Title, but that of the Sword, Violence, and forcible Entry. Now King <hi>William</hi> holds this Sovereignty by the former legal way of National Contract, and Civil Eſtabliſhment; but <hi>O. C.</hi> had no other Mode of Profeſſion, but Tyrannical; and ſo had no legal (which is the only Form of) Authority. And yet beſide, perhaps the very Style of King is neceſſary to the real Sovereigns of <hi>England,</hi> in order to their Claims of Allegiance, by virtue of the old Oath and Laws; tho' when new Laws and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons extinguiſh the old, a new Allegiance may be due to a new Sovereign under any other Titular Style. But if this Style be thus neceſſary to oblige
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102364:81"/>our Allegiance by the old Laws, then for want of that very Character, no Allegiance was due to <hi>O. C.</hi> by our old Laws, which was the firſt thing in queſtion.

For the improvement of which I will further demonſtrate, that he was no King, either in Name, or Thing. For firſt, he was Created even by his own Faction, not Sovereign, but Protector only of the People. And that Office was not Royal, as appears by the third and fourth Articles of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his Government, inſtituted by his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers firſt, and after again pretendedly confirmed by his pretended Houſe of Commons, which he had firſt purged of all ſuſpected Perſons, and this, after he had refuſed the Style of King, which he ſaw would not paſs Muſter in his Army. Tho' there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Ruled by the force of his Confederacy, yet not as legal Sovereign, nor according to any Law, or lawful <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But if you will allow meer Force to be ſufficient to a Settlement and Conſtitution, then all the little Elves and Goblins of Power, that after him pretended to ſit at Helm in the whole courſe of thoſe Changes, till the Return of the Royal Family, were all worſhipful Muſhroom So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns forſooth. And what I have heard a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Parts, Honour, and Authority, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay, that tho he is no very Old Man, yet he hath ſeen five and twenty Governments in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was perhaps as ſeverely true, as it ſeemed pleaſantly ſpoken.

                        <p>Tho' I mentioned his Non-pretenſion, as well as incapacity to pretend a National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, to argue thence, that really he had none, yet the intended force of my Reaſoning, lies in his real want of ſuch Contract, of which his Non-pretenſion, in his Caſe, and care for Pretenſions, is a Moral Argument. For had he really had it, the Civil effect had been the ſame without a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, which alone can have no Civil Efficacie, or Obligation. But however, that I may not ſeem to neglect your Pretences, let us examine his. I allow therefore, that he made ſome Pretence, but none to the Lord's Houſe, which he utterly caſhier'd, which yet however had been, and ſtill is, neceſſary to a National Contract. I allow you alſo, that he pretended his Advancement by the People, as the word reſtrainedly ſignifies the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England;</hi> and he had a ſmall Colour for this, in the acknowledgment of the Uſurping Pack, that pretended to ſit for the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> againſt all the Laws and Rights of the People. And yet, had theſe been a free, fair, and full Repreſentative, they could not have
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102364:82"/>given <hi>O. C.</hi> a Legal Dominion over the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Eſtate of Peers, becauſe the Commons never had it themſelves. But as the word People pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly comprehends all ſubject Orders, Eſtates, or Perſons of the Realm, ſo neither did, nor could he pretend an Advancement by the People. But the main point we are concerned in, and which you can ſay nothing for, pertinent to our Debate, is, to what State, Stile, or Character he was advanced, or pretended to be advanced by them, whom he called the People? Was it to a real Royal Soveraignty? No, no; his Mouth Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, his Bowels hanker'd at it, but he was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever forc'd to ſit down, and pretend only to a Protectory Truſt for the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                        <p>Here I think my ſelf obliged to do your Party right, that theſe are not their common Sentiments. This was a ſingular <hi>Noſtrum</hi> of your aſſuming Emperick, to heal a diſeaſed Cauſe. But by the good leave of the Lords and Commons, whom I have no mind to ſet at variance, we will ſift theſe odd Politicks. Is it then firſt of all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>O. C.</hi> did not think a Lords Houſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a National Contract? If he did, it's no matter, if he did not think them National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives. The Language of Men herein is various; many Men commonly aſſert the whole Parliament to repreſent the Nation, ſince what is Enacted by them and the King altogether is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Act of the Nation. But ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Lords are no formal Repreſentatives, nor did I ever ſay they were, tho' you would trump the term of Repreſentation upon me, to enſnare me to a conceſſion that the Lords repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But I am not ſo to be tricked. I know the Lords to be an Eſtate Originally Principal, acting Perſonally for themſelves in their own Right, and Name, not in the Name, or on the Miſſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and under the King they are the upper part of the Parliament and People in the moſt comprehenſive Senſe of this word. But the lower
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102364:83"/>Houſe only are the Repreſentatives of their Reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Counties, Cities, and Burroughs, in whoſe Name, and Right they Act for all the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> But if <hi>O. C.</hi> knew the Lords Houſe neceſſary to the King himſelf to Enact the Bills e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Commons into Laws, could he think them needleſs to the legitimating his Order, or his Acts? Surely he could not, except upon this one only ſuppoſition, that he thought nothing could legitimate it, which is indeed not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; but then that exauctorates the Commons alſo of that Power, by which he pretended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf advanced. But could <hi>O. C.</hi> otherwiſe think the Lords needleſs to his Legitimation, upon this emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impertinent Speculation, that there could be no Lords in the Original Contract? Which can be true neither in any other ſenſe but this, that in the firſt Conſtitution of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Land, there could be no Houſe of Lords. No, verily; for before, or till then, they were in a mere ruſtic, Paſtoral, and agricolarian Habit, Quality, and Condition. But ſince that there have been many Changes of Governments, and in them of Sovereigns, by National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. And hence, I ſay, ever ſince there have been Baronies, and Peerage in <hi>England,</hi> in every ſettled Change of Government, and Sovereigns, made by National Contract, the Lords were in thoſe Acts that originated thoſe Settlements, Titles, and Sovereigns, and ſo would have been originally neceſſary to an Original Contract for <hi>O. C</hi>'s Conſtitution, tho once in a ſtate of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, a ſeditious Party of the Commons voted them uſeleſs. But I ask you fairly; Was that Vote of theirs Truth, or Law? If ſo, why have the Kings and Commons ever ſince admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102364:84"/>their Uſe, as well as Right? If not, why did you alledge it in Bar to the Rights of Peer rage? But ſuppoſing that wicked Vote had been at that time true; yet who had made them ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs but they by ſeditious Violences? Now would you think it reaſonable to cut off a Man's Hands, and then reproach him, and caſt him out as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs? But I will beat back this dull Weapon on your own Head, and mind you, that theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, City, and Burrough-Charters of ſending Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, could not be in the firſt Original Contract for Civil Government, as being alſo of later Extraction. So that upon your Theory, <hi>O. C.</hi> muſt think them alſo needleſs in order to his Conſtitution, who pleaſantly new named <hi>Magna Charta, Magna F—ta.</hi> And ſo at laſt the Truth will come about unawares, that <hi>O. C.</hi> had no form of Title from King, Lords, or Commons of <hi>England.</hi> Again, if the Lords Houſe ſhould upon a critical Juncture turn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogue, and rabble the Commons out of Heart, and Houſe, would it be fair for the Lords here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to vote them off as uſeleſs? 'Tis ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous therefore to draw Arguments from Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and notorious Violences to juſtifie a wrong Cauſe; and therefore henceforward give us in Truth, what you ſeem to Challenge and glory in, juſt Weights and Meaſures; at leaſt be not ſo ſhamefully diſloyal, as to dry up in the King that Fountain of Honour by which he Creates the Peerage, and who is the original Founder of all Charters. As for the Lords not aſſuming to give away the Peoples Money, as not being their Repreſentatives, 'tis nothing to the purpoſe againſt their concurring Intereſt in Contracting for new Conſtitutions; tho' neither Houſe can ſeparately
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102364:84"/>give away the Peoples Money, altho' thoſe Bills are by regular cuſtom prepared in the Lower Houſe. Nor are theſe Rights of the Peerage ſo alien from the good of the general Body, but that we and the better part of the lower Houſe have ſenſibly owed our Peace, and Preſervation to the Integrity, Care, Wiſdom, and Honour of that Upper Houſe, when many of our own over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charioteers have been furiouſly driving on all to the Precipice.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102364:85"/>of the Nation, as can well be imagined; he was obeyed at home, and owned abroad, if not in all, yet in moſt of the Courts in Chriſtendome.</hi>

                        <p>How your Diſcourſe conſents to it ſelf, I do not well underſtand. Juſt now you ſaid <hi>O. C.</hi> did not pretend to have a free Houſe of Commons; now in the ſame Breath you ſay, they called themſelves free, and no Man durſt ſay the contrary, and <hi>O. C.</hi> owned them. Now did he own them to be free, as they called themſelves? If ſo, then he pretended to have a free Houſe of Commons contrary to what you ſay. If he did not own them as free as they owned themſelves, he muſt then either not own them at all, or only as Vaſſals, and I leave it to your Choice to take either of thoſe Handles, for there is no way to extricate you from the ties of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But whatſoever freedom this knot of Men had, it could amount to no more than the freedom of <hi>Banditi,</hi> or Rapparees, or any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppreſſible Rout, which is but a mere impunity to do Evil, and wrong the innocent. But the freedom we are ſpeaking of is Civil, conſiſting in the Popular liberty of Election, Seſſion, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and Votes. Yet the very Houſe, that Conſtituted him Protector, was firſt purged of all ſuſpected Members, and upon their after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, his Conſtitution began to be queſtioned as much, and for this <hi>O. C.</hi> diſſolved them in moſt ſacred Rage. And for the truth hereof alſo I call in Teſtimony the Senſe of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, as ſoon as opportunity offer'd it ſelf by <hi>Monk,</hi> declared for, and after met in a free Parliament, which before they had long wanted. And hence it appears alſo the Senſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102364:85"/>that neither the Rights of Peerage, nor the Freedom of Corporations had been Legally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the former Tyranny. As for the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations of Foreign Courts, they are no Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of a National Contract, or Form of Legal Settlement here. For as Foreigners are no Judges of our Tenures, ſo they meddle not with them, but only treat with the actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Powers, whether Legal or Uſurpant, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants or Rebels, its almoſt all one to Strangers. They give them all good words to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of them, but if diſguſted, they then change the Tune into all the juſter Names and Titles of Oppreſſion and Villany, if they can do it ſafely. So that there is no concludency in this ſort of Reaſoning, tho' yet at the beſt, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and Strangers owned him no otherwiſe than he ſtiled himſelf, not the Sovereign, but the Protector only of the People. But the boldeſt ſtroke of all is, that he had as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Obedience, and ſeeming a Conſent of the whole Nation as can well be imagined. For the formal conſent of both Houſes, ſitting free from terrour, may eaſily ſeem, and be imagined much more properly, formally, and validly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, than meer enforced ſilence, and patience under irreſiſtible domination. Nay, we as yet have no other way of National Conſent but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary, without which all Perſonal Contracts, or Engagements to intruding Powers are null, and not legally interpretable to any Civil Form, or Obligation, and ſo not to be drawn into a pretence for a National Conſent.

                           </note> 
                           <hi>That the Prayers were conſented to by all the Recuſant Biſhops, and by them</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">[For their Officers] was a miſprint.</note> 
                           <hi>or their Officers without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prohibition) ſent to the Clergy of every Dioceſe, and by them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received. The Biſhops were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at them, directed their Clergy upon Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to uſe them; and thus things ſtood till the Day of their Suſpenſion, and no blowing of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet againſt Perjury. Now if this were true, yet
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102364:86"/>if the Prayers are truly chargeable with ſomething unlawful, and wicked; that is ſuch a daring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to God Almighty, that neither any Act, or Neglect of theirs can juſtify either your or my Concurrence in them. And therefore I wonder why you ſhould make ſuch a Lye, when it will not ſerve you for a Reaſon. For it is well known to all, who frequented their Communion, that they never read or uſed thoſe Prayers, and that is no improbable Argument, that they neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, nor ſent them abroad. But the truth is, that they were ſo far from either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to them, or ſending them to their Clergy, that they had no opportunity of the thing, 'till it was done and paſt. And whether ſome Body told you this Lye, or you made it your ſelf, if you pleaſe to conſult the Printer in the</hi> Savoy,—<hi>he can tell you how they were ſent, and who ſent them, and that thoſe whom you call Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Biſhops, were purpoſely kept ignorant, that they might not be able to give any obſtructions to the buſineſs. And now, Sir, do not you think, that you have acted a very mannerly Part to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers, in exclaiming againſt them, and comparing them to winking Watch-men, and dumb Dogs, becauſe they do not get up o'th' top of the Monument, and baul out againſt a thing, which they knew nothing of?

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102364:87"/>God forbid! but on an undoubted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their Sincerity, to infer, that they then as well as we, did not judge thoſe Prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. And it is a fair Argument in Moral Charges, uſed and allowed by all Orators, that we had the Conſent of thoſe, who now diſſent from us, if at leaſt thoſe Fathers do yet diſſent from us. But now I am brought in upon an uneaſie Stage, upon which we are not ſo much to Argue, as to give and take the Lye; and not only ſo, but to be under Provocation to diſcover Secrets againſt Moral Inclination, or otherwiſe to undergo the Cenſure of a Lyar.

Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon admiſſion of their Majeſties to the Throne, an Order of Council paſſed for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Names and Royal Character in the Liturgy inſtead of King <hi>James,</hi> and this Order was ſent down to every See, and from thence to every Pariſh in all the Dioceſes of <hi>England.</hi> Now can any Man think, that all this was done in Corners, and managed in the Dark, to keep the diſſenting Biſhops ignorant hereof, when it was impoſſible to conceal the Deſign from the Senſe and expectation of the meaneſt Idiot, who muſt know, that the change of Sovereigns draws after it ſuch a certain change in the Prayers? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay this Order was ſent directly to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops by Name, but if not, it was to their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102364:87"/>Officers and Regiſters. And were they alſo ſo much in the Secret, as to keep their Watchful Lords in ignorance, and ſo cloſely to ſend the Form to the Cathedrals, and Pariſhes, that theſe deluded Fathers ſhould know nothing of it? But when however theſe ſurprized Fathers were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed in their Cathedrals with theſe new wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prayers, why did they continue to frequent them, without ſending the Claſſick to their Prohibition; 'till the Day of their Suſpenſion in Aug. 89? And in that interval, adminiſter the Sacrament at the Cathedral Altars, where theſe Sovereigns were then prayed for? Why here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon had there not been ſome publick Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance to the Dioceſes, or Rural Deanries, that the Biſhops knew nothing of that Order being ſent them, and that they did not allow, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it by a firm Injunction? None of this was done to undeceive the Clergy, who received the Order as ſent them by their Biſhops. And I could produce you Inſtances of Recuſant Clergy-Men, who then read thoſe Prayers on that preſumption, and alledge it for their Apology, when Taxed hereof upon their preſent inconformity. Here was half a Years time to have repreſſed, or at leaſt to have condemned this Service, yet all paſt in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in their viſible Communion. During this Tract of time can any Man think, that no Clergy Men had any Conferences with their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Biſhops hereupon? And in thoſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences did thoſe Fathers Condemn, and forbid theſe Prayers, at which themſelves were daily preſent? No, I believe no where; and ſomewhere in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances I know the contrary, that directions have been given to uſe our preſent Forms. But one thing I will further tell you, that theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102364:88"/>Fathers were not ſo gulled, as you pretend, in the firſt motions. For upon the Enthroning of their preſent Majeſties, and the Change of the Prayers, and Oath of new Allegiance; the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Biſhops met together in Conſultation, how to act in theſe Affairs, and after all Debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated, they came to this Reſolution, that they would not oppoſe the Prayers, for that it would ſeem too invidious and uncharitable, to deny their Majeſties our Devotions, but determined only to ſtick at the Oath. This I preſume thoſe Fathers will not deny; and if any of them ſhould hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter challenge me for this Report, I will give them my Author, whom I preſume no Man can Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach of falſehood, or Detraction. But I would not have mentioned this, had not you reproached me with the Lye, even while you endeavour to cover the moſt evident Truths with Clouds and Darkneſs. Nor do I mention this to caſt a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh on them. For did not their Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem to them Schiſmatical, I believe they would not have repudiated our Communion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mere account of our Prayers, as neither did your great <hi>Coryphaeus</hi> till the Deprivation of the Primate. All which is open Truth, tho' theſe Fathers never read theſe Prayers, which I never charged on them, ſince 'tis otherwiſe very rare to hear Biſhops reading the Prayers in any Church whatſoever. And this Conceſſion to theſe Prayers being paſt on their moſt ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, there was no Cauſe why they ſhould blow the Trumpet againſt what they judged lawful. But had they really judged the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this concurrence had been worſe than the neglect of winking Watch-Men, or the ſilence of dumb Dogs, to which I never compared them,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102364:88"/>tho' your Cenſorious Rigours muſt brand this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration with more infamous Characters, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from this Diſcourſe of yours, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of the firſt Part of your Treatiſe of Chriſtian Communion. And having thus vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated their Equity and my Reverence thereof, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſuch a Man of Manners, as you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved your ſelf hitherto to be, ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled our Fathers alſo a little more decently, and not (as generally you do) with Tinctures drawn from the Lake of <hi>Sodom.</hi> But to leave you to the felicity of your own good Humours, I ſhall only obſerve, what a ſilly <hi>innuendo</hi> you flurt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Secretaries, or Council of State, that they were in great fear, what ſtirs theſe Biſhops would make, had they not concerted with Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> to carry on this Religious Intrigue in the Blind, whereas theſe Fathers expected their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Fate with all imaginable calmneſs, and ſerenity, as Men that well underſtood the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Saints. And in that exemplary Patience they were impatient at thoſe, who thro' too great bitterneſs, called our Conformity, <hi>the Apoſtacy of the Church of</hi> England; for the truth of which, if you will not believe me, I hope you will Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> to whom I therefore refer you for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And therefore you, that would raiſe you a Monument out of thoſe Flames you kindle, by reproaching us with infamous Imputations, recede from the pattern, and act without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of your Fathers.</p>

The greateſt Objection againſt this that I <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                           <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:102364:90"/>know is, what your great Author of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion herein offers, that they that look upon new Sovereigns only as Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> do herein pray for the Subverſion of Right, and him that has it, and theſe make up a great Number of the preſent Conformiſts. But that queſtion properly comes under diſpute upon the Notion of <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>Victory</hi> in our Prayers, and on that Head it ſhall be conſidered. The only queſtion here is, if a King <hi>de facto</hi> can be our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord? This I know you deny, and if your denial be good, it preſſes our Prayers much, if offered for a King by us taken for <hi>de facto</hi> only. But if the Nation hath a lawful Right upon great Exigences to admit a Perſon into the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who had no Right to enforce them thereto, then as to the Nations part they have lawfully admitted him to be their Sovereign Lord, and have yielded him all that Authority over us, that the Laws of the Land in ſuch Neceſſity allow us to concede. And ſuch is the Caſe in all Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon new Conqueſts, tho' injuriouſly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. For in ſuch Caſes the ſubmitting People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Authentic Judges upon the Cauſe of the new Potentate, can only judge for themſelves what they may lawfully do, and leave his Cauſe to God, whether he on his Part takes the Crown <hi>de jure,</hi> or no. Thus before the Recognition this Nation had <hi>de facto</hi> admitted K. <hi>William,</hi> and every Perſon was bound to receive him at leaſt for ſuch, and had there never been any Recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>de jure,</hi> no Man was an habil Judge to have condemned the <hi>jus,</hi> whatſoever Mens various O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in private might have been, on which they ought to have laid no ſtreſs, but to have received him as their actually ſettled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Sovereign Lord, and required no more; ſince no more was determinately required of them. If a Captive in <hi>Algiers,</hi> &amp;c. be required
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102364:91"/>to pray for his Lord and Maſter, that is ſo only <hi>de facto,</hi> he may certainly do ſo under thoſe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and is bound to do ſo upon command, if he has contracted Service. I know you will here ſay, this Contract gives the Tyrant Right; But then you muſt grant, that the Submiſſion of a Nation paſſes Right <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and then you put the Nation <hi>de facto</hi> only clear out of doors. Here you will reply, that ſuch Submiſſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>de jure,</hi> as being injurious to the preſent Right of another; But then ſo will I ſay, the Captives Submiſſion and Contract is againſt the permanent Right of his Parents, or former Maſter, who thereby may lawfully reſcue him by force of Arms. And yet notwithſtanding this the poor Slave, may thus pray for the Captivant as his Lord; nay, even that he may vanquiſh and overcome all his Enemies, even while the former Proprietors are fighting for his Reſcue, in the ſame Senſe we intend in our Prayers for our moſt rightful Sovereigns, as ſhall clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the fifth Head of this Anſwer. King <hi>William</hi> therefore being actually our Sovereign Lord, even by our own warrantable Contract, we may lawfully uſe theſe Prayers for him, and on his Command are bound to do ſo, even tho' he were only King <hi>de facto</hi> in the legal Senſe of this Term, and not altogether, as we have owned him, <hi>de pleno jure;</hi> becauſe it will appear, that theſe Prayers are not levelled againſt any Man's Right, tho' they are againſt all his Enemies. Now the truth is, the Relation, we lately ſtood in to K. <hi>James</hi> as our then Sovereign, makes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted Men pity his whole perſonal Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and conſequently unwilling to pray againſt him, if there be any fair, or lawful way to avoid it, which there is not, if he comes not into the Number of thoſe Enemies, which we are to pray againſt. Such alſo is the Temper of poor People
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102364:91"/>under new Conqueſts toward their former Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, when obliged to pray for the new (that appear no otherwiſe than <hi>de facto</hi> ſuch) againſt all their Enemies. Yet this is only an Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bowels and good Nature, but not of ſtrict and impartial Reaſon, (tho' it influences much upon Men's Spirits) but is to be guided, and corrected in its Exceſſes thereby. Hence upon the beginning of this Change an excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that was eaſily ſatisfied in owning their Majeſties Title Sovereign in the Prayers, yet ſtumbled at the Paſſages about Enemies, till he receiv'd with much pleaſure this very Anſwer, for which you deride me. But, as I have now ſaid, the only material Queſtion here is, if K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> actually are our Sovereigns? for this being granted, all the reſt follows of due Courſe without reſpect of Perſons, whoſoever be their Enemies without exception. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I was willing to give you as healing a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive as I could, that I might not widen the Wound, nor exaſperate the Diviſion; but, it ſeems, while I labour for Peace, you make you ready for Battel.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This ſeemeth to be the Senſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned <hi>Jacobites,</hi> without which I ſee not how their Practices can be juſtified. For, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Conſent and Communion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Fathers in theſe Prayers before the Day of their Suſpenſion, there are yet many mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men among you, that read theſe Prayers, tho' deprived for filing the Oath. Now do you think, that theſe Men direct their Prayers againſt K. <hi>James?</hi> If they do, then upon your Principles they break their Allegiance and Oath to him, which they judge oblige them to this very Day. Which methinks ſhould make you leſs laviſh of your perjurious Imputations upon others, whoſe Principles acquit them from wilful and intended<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102364:92"/>Perjury. Yet there is no way for theſe Men of yours to avoid this Charge upon your Principles, but by ſuch a Senſe of Enemies, in which it is poſſible K. <hi>James</hi> may not be included. But if they intend not their Prayers at <hi>K. James,</hi> how are we charged for praying againſt him, when we and theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> in the ſame Words may ſincerely uſe the ſame Senſe? ſo that in good truth, the Account I gave of theſe Prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Plea neceſſary, not ſo much to us, as to your own more moderate and equal Brethren, againſt whom therefore for the future you muſt turn your Style, and Acrimony.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I will now proceed to juſtifie my Senſe to be the only allowable Senſe of our Prayers under any the juſteſt Reign whatſoever, and not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated by me to the preſent Juncture. This will firſt require me more fully to open the principal Notions of the word Enemy, than for reaſons private to my ſelf I did in my laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The word Enemy therefore has two known principal Acceptations, moral, and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Morally an Enemy is one that intendeth Injury, or Hurt; and ſo this Senſe carries Malice in it. Militarily an Enemy is an oppoſite of War, which innocent Princes, People, and Perſons may be forced to be, who have no Malice, or moral Enmity; as in Self-defences againſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, in which it is poſſible, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents would not willingly hurt any of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, nor engage even in an advantageous Battel, if it could be avoided, but gladly cloſe up the War. And yet both the injurious Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, and all Neuters in the Cauſe by cuſtom call theſe juſt Defendents Enemies to the other Oppoſite, not charging them with moral Injury, but reſpecting their military Oppoſition. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> have two proper diſtinctive Names for theſe two ſorts of Enemies, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102364:92"/>and <hi>inimicus</hi> for the Moral; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <hi>hoſtis</hi> for the military Enemy. Other Opponents are moſt properly called Adverſaries, as a Term of a more comprehenſive Latitude, reaching to the general Nature of all ſorts of Contention, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or ſportive, good, or bad.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, We are to examin the importance of Vanquiſhing, and Victory. For this indeed ſeems to admit a far greater, and benigner La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſignification, than you in your Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeem to allow. For you ſeem to apprehend no Victory but in Butcheries, Ruines, and Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Whereas many ſucceſsful Expeditions, (as that of General <hi>Monk</hi>) have been victorious without Hurt; ſince ſimply, and in general to overcome is no more than to prevail againſt any Opponents, or Oppoſitions, whatſoever fort they are of, even where there is no Enmity, as in Games, Wagers, Votes, and Competitions. And there is one ſort of Victory more noble than any other, the overcoming Evil with Good, which is God's eſpecial way of vanquiſhing the Powers of Evil. And even in War thoſe Victories are moſt noble, where leaſt Hurt is done, and moſt Mercy ſhewed; and thereupon the beſt and moſt noble Deſires of Victory are thoſe, whereby we wiſh to prevail againſt our Enemy, if it be poſſible, without hurting him, or his Party at all, and more than this we are not abſolutely to wiſh, or pray for, even againſt the greateſt Enemies, by the Laws of our moſt compaſſionate and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion, which allows Wars only to be waged againſt our Will, not with delight and bloody Affectations.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We are to conſider againſt what Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies it is lawful to pray for even the gentleſt Victories. Firſt, then it is not lawful to pray for any Victory againſt the Innocent, in the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of his Cauſe; no, tho' when he ſtan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:102364:93"/>in his own Defence, the Cuſtom of milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Language calls him Enemy. <hi>For if I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi> Thus 'tis not lawful for Pirates to pray for ſucceſs againſt innocent Merchants ſtanding on their own Defence; becauſe here Victory in the Pirates ſide doth not import the Defeat of an Injurious Intention, but an Injury. It was not lawful for K. <hi>Saul</hi> to pray for Victory over his Subject <hi>David,</hi> tho' at the Head of an armed Band for Self-preſervation, for the ſame reaſon. Whence it follows, that no injurious Prince may <note n="†" place="margin">So the fifth Senior bids <hi>Ptolemy Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> to expect Victory, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> pray for ſucceſs againſt the Innocent, whom he deſigns to oppreſs. And if ſo, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may his Subjects pray for his Victory over the Innocent, for that they may not petition more for him, than he may for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Otherwiſe Prayers as directly contrary as juſt and unjuſt, would be allowable and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with God. And here indeed ſtarts up a doubt, how the oppoſite Devotions of warring Nations againſt their reſpective Princes Enemies, can at the ſame time on both ſides be juſtified for lawful and religious, ſince one at leaſt of the Princes muſt be unjuſt, and for the Succeſs of ſuch a Prince in his Injuſtice all Prayers are unjuſt? To the ſolution of which doubt it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that no religious or lawful Prayers for Temporal benefits are, tho' never ſo earneſt, ſimply abſolute, and peremptory, but always conceived with a deference and reſignation to God's Will, either expreſly, or implicitly, after our Saviour's Example in his moſt earneſt Prayers at the Approach of his Paſſion, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me, yet not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:102364:93"/>So then our Prayers for victory to our Prince im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a reſervation to God's will, if he ſees fit to admit them; but we knowing that all injuſtice is contrariant to the will of God, refer our Princes cauſe to God's judgments, and will, againſt which we intend no Prayers, but ground them all on a tacit and preſuming ſuppoſition, that our Cauſe is right. For it would be a very impious form of Prayer to ſay, <hi>give ſucceſs, O Lord, to our Prince in all his deſigns of ravage and oppreſſion.</hi> So that, tho' the ſuppoſition of Juſtice at the bottom of all ſuch Prayers be not uſually expreſſed to prevent common jealouſie in the Subject, yet it is reſerved by decent preſumption as the proper duty of the Subject toward his Sovereign, over whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels he has no judgment. And accordingly all our public Prayers in time of War propoſe the malice, pride, and oppreſſion of our Enemies as the juſt cauſes of our ſupplication, and ground of our zeal, and object of God's Indignation, acording to the ſtanding Forms of ſuch devotions in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And ſo a moral enmity ſuppoſed in our military Enemies, with our own preſuming inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, with a virtual or open appeal and reference to God the Judge of all, is the only Foundation of ſuch Prayers, and the only Reaſon, that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſuch oppoſite Liturgies of warring Nations with Religion and Innocency. And if you think this too diſloyal and cold a form of Devotion, I pray think again, what an odd ſort of Loyalty it is to your King, to contend even with God for his injuſtice, and to offer him your Sacrifices after the impious manner of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> to accept and promote the abominations of yo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Sixthly, it is to be conſidered; why Princes are ſo particularly named above other Orders in theſe national Prayers againſt Enemies? And the reaſon is obvious, becauſe the intereſt of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is ſummed up in the Felicity of their Kings. So that they that are his Enemies, are taken for the Nations Enemies alſo in theſe Prayers. In praying therefore againſt K. <hi>William</hi>'s Enemies, we conſider him not merely as a ſingle ſolitary Perſon, but as our Sovereign Head, on whoſe welfare our own alſo depends, and ſo in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies we pray againſt our own alſo.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, we muſt enquire whether K. <hi>James</hi> muſt in our Prayers inevitably come into the number of K. <hi>William</hi>'s enemies, and ſo by civil Conſtruction the Nations enemies? Now when theſe Prayers were firſt ordered and received, K. <hi>James</hi> was in no part of his old Dominions, nor in any actual ſenſible military Hoſtility againſt K. <hi>William</hi> any where. For tho' the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were in Commotion, yet K. <hi>James</hi> was not there, nor does it appear that they acted on his Commiſſion, but mere preſumption, and that not againſt K. <hi>William,</hi> till his Armies came thither, but their domeſtic Proteſtants only. It ſeemed a while as if K. <hi>James</hi> had ſat down, and yielded up to his fate, and ſtate of deſertion. After the ſettled courſe of theſe Prayers re-animated by the <hi>French</hi> King he enters <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he courſe and ſenſe of the Prayers was ſtill the ſame, r<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>yond the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Channel, as there was no reaſon they ſhould. And ſo K. <hi>James</hi> was no more particularized after than before this in our Prayers. Yet if his perſonal behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102364:94"/>K. <hi>William</hi> at the <hi>Boyne</hi> doth not evince the contrary, I will allow you, that then he was a military enemy. But ſtill the grand queſtion is, whether alſo he was a moral enemy (and ſo within the intention of our Prayers) by his then preſent breaking it off from <hi>England,</hi> and his deſigns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to recover <hi>England?</hi> And plain it is, that the ſence of our Nation, which is valid and cogent to all Civil obligations, doth conclude him an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and moral enemy to K. <hi>William,</hi> and this Realm. For <hi>Ireland</hi> belonging thro' a long fixed Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> it muſt appear injurious, after an effectual Abdication of this Crown, and a Settlement of a Title therein upon K. <hi>William,</hi> to invade <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo to reduce us here under war for a recovery thereof, and a defence of our own land from his illegal claims, and pretenſions. And whereas without any ſenſe of modeſty you ſay, that I aſſert K. <hi>James</hi> and K. <hi>William</hi> not to be enemies, but good friends, <hi>viz.</hi> that K. <hi>James</hi> is ſo friendly to K. <hi>William,</hi> for that he intends K. <hi>William</hi> no injury, you may reſume your forehead, and remember, that I only ſaid, <hi>we are not ſure that K.</hi> James <hi>deſigns K.</hi> William <hi>injury.</hi> But what we are not infallibly ſure of, we may verily believe, and preſume from all the Rules of humane Judgment upon acts of Hoſtility. And in all humane opinion his Invaſion of <hi>Ireland</hi> was injurious, but ſince all judicial Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be left and referred to God's Judgment, we, not mentioning K. <hi>James</hi> in the number of K. <hi>Williams</hi> Enemies, do not paſs our internal and perſonal Cenſure on the Conſcience of K. <hi>James</hi> before our God, but remit that to God the Judge of all Kings and Nations. But if private Perſons will intermix their own perſonal opinions upon ſuch ſuperiour Cauſes where they need not, then they, who think K. <hi>James</hi> a moral Enemy to K. <hi>William,</hi> do uſe our forms againſt him on that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102364:95"/>of his injury; they that do not think ſo of K. <hi>James,</hi> do not in this form of Liturgy pray againſt him. And the Liturgy, not compelling us in the acts of our Religion to condemn K. <hi>James</hi> as morally injurious, does not oblige any man determinately to involve him under any of our imprecations. And whereas our Prayers are upbraided in the ſecond Chapter of your firſt Book of Chriſtian Communion as directed againſt Right for the maintenance of wrong, it hereby appears, how much miſtaken that great Author was; for whoſoever can but comport with the Sovereign Style of their preſent Majeſties, may uſe theſe Prayers without prejudice to any real Rights of K. <hi>James,</hi> or his own private opinions concerning it. As to K. <hi>James</hi>'s Perſonal hurt, or injury, let them, that can feed an evil, wiſh it for me. God hath diſabled him from overturning our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hath ſettled us under good and equal Governours, and that is enough; and if K. <hi>James</hi> be elſewhere happy, as long as he hurts not us, we need no further trouble our ſelves, or him. And I do verily believe, their preſent Majeſties as little require my Prayers for his hurt, as you do. For time was, when he was in the hands of K. <hi>William,</hi> who, had he deſigned to hurt him, might have done it, and thereby have prevented all the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that have coſt ſo much Blood and Treaſure in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But 'twas piouſly done to abſtain his hands from Royal Blood, and leave the Iſſues of his undertakings to the Rules of innocency, on which only he could dare to pray for, and expect God's bleſſing. But further you have forgotten one Argument, perhaps becauſe it was inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whereby it appears, that our prayers are not pointed againſt any Rights of K. <hi>James,</hi> or to any hurt of his Perſon, <hi>for that we pray for all Chriſtian Kings, Princes and Governours, even th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe, againſt whom we wage open war.</hi> And out of theſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102364:95"/>Prayers we do not except even the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King, but pray for the preſervation of him alſo in all his Rights, our war not obſtructing this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Piety even to our greateſt enemies, which we obſerve from the precept and example of our moſt bleſſed Saviour. And therefore, though it were true what you would ſeem to prove in form of Argument, that K. <hi>James</hi> is accounted a greater Enemy (and if you pleaſe, add a greater King too) than the <hi>French</hi> King, yet no Enmity ought to be great enough to overcome our Religion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in praying for our very greateſt Enemies, even while we pray againſt their Enmities. But let us however ſee, whether K. <hi>William</hi> and his Subjects do take K. <hi>James</hi> for a greater Enemy than the <hi>French</hi> King, who it ſeems to you is accounted an Enemy only for aſſerting K. <hi>James</hi>'s Cauſe. Firſt then, if we take the moral notion of Enemy, no man can judge, whether K. <hi>James</hi> or K. <hi>Lewis</hi> has the greater internal enmity againſt K. <hi>William.</hi> If we go upon the military notion it is apparently falſe that K. <hi>James</hi> either is, or is accounted a greater Enemy than he, that is the greateſt in Arms of all the Chriſtian Monarchs. So that your axiom, from whence you form your Argument, <hi>Propter quod unumquod<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> eſt tale, id magis eſt tale,</hi> tho' true in Phyſical Cauſalities and Operations, yet fails in moral Influences, and Inducements, ſuch as are the reaſons of humane Confederacies. And truly if K. <hi>William</hi> himſelf would, upon reference made, deliver his ſenſe, he would declare K. <hi>Lewis</hi> more injurious than K. <hi>James</hi> in this war; for K. <hi>James</hi> ſeems to have ſome colour for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; but K. <hi>Lewis</hi> had none to engage in K. <hi>James</hi>'s quarrels. But if he engages on other Reaſons, then he is not an enemy on K. <hi>James</hi>'s account, but his own. And if K. <hi>James</hi> and K. <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould ever happen to come into K. <hi>Williams</hi> hands, there would be ſo ſenſible a difference in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102364:96"/>his reſpects toward them, as would diſcover his reſentments of <hi>French</hi> injuries as greater than K. <hi>James</hi>'s, tho' unqueſtionably he would ſhew a Royal compaſſion to them both.</p>
                     <p>And now I am provided with a Reaſon, why I diſlike your Prayers for victory to the late K. <hi>James</hi> againſt K. <hi>William.</hi> Firſt, becauſe your Prayers aſſert the late K. <hi>James</hi> to be our preſent King, and import K. <hi>William</hi> to be the Nations Enemy, whereby you condemn, and pray againſt the preſent Conſtitution, of which by our Law, and conſequently God's Law, you are ſubjects, not Judges, nor <hi>de jure Adverſaries.</hi> Again, you confeſs you pray abſolutely againſt K. <hi>William,</hi> as K. <hi>James</hi>'s Enemy. And this you muſt judge of him either in the moral, or military ſenſe. If in the moral, you muſt then do it, either of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty, or opinion only. The former the matter is not capable of, becauſe of the darkneſs of men's interiour paſſions, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable nature of Civil Titles. But upon mere opinions you ought not to paſs abſolute Cenſure upon any mans Conſcience, and become his utter Enemy by your own choice. And yet were K. <hi>William</hi> infallibly and certainly injurious to K. <hi>James,</hi> yet ſince K. <hi>James</hi>'s Ceſſation of war to pray for ſuch victories of blood, which you alone account victory, is to pray for a return of a Ceſſant War in order to a ſanguinary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and its Conſequences. If you take K. <hi>William</hi> only as a military Enemy, he was then innocent, and ſo your Prayers then aimed at the ruine of the innocent, and his Cauſe. But now he is no military Enemy to K. <hi>James,</hi> 'tis more impious to pray for his Ruine, which K. <hi>James</hi> himſelf does not now attempt. Upon which even K. <hi>James</hi> himſelf has opened our Church-Doors to you to joyn with us in our Prayers for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> But if you take the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102364:96"/>
                        <hi>French</hi> War to be K. <hi>James</hi>'s, we have all reaſon to thank you kindly for your Prayers, in a time of ſuch a dangerous War, as not only affects all our Temporals, but our very Church, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the nobleſt Structure, and Bulwark of the Reformation; Of which God in mercy make you truly ſenſible, and even in this reſpect turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the diſobedient to the Wiſdom of the Juſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>This I confeſs is a dangerous foyl. Nor was I well aware of that naſute quickneſs, which appears in this Stricture. But as argute as you are, was it I that thought this Prayer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or my brother <hi>Dyſcheres?</hi> Was it not you, that complained, that in that Prayer, <hi>there is a vow of Allegiance to K.</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>which upon your Principles you cannot be preſent at, or concede?</hi> Well then, this was ſo; and what ſaid I? <hi>Then forbear to be preſent at it.</hi> But muſt this preſently be interpreted to an Act, or Power diſpenſing with the Duty?

And I pray God you fail not in this Duty towards God for his mercies to the Nation, as you do towards thoſe that wiſh you well, becauſe they run not with you into your unaccountable exceſſes. But as to our Governours, if I have not hereby arrogated the diſpenſing Power, I hope I have not much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; If I have for your ungrateful ſakes, I will endeavour to atone for this one offence, and have a Care how I enſnare my ſelf again upon your Score.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102364:98"/>ſuch a tempeſt about what is nothing to the purpoſe of my diſcourſe, and, beſides the green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſpite, diſcovers much ignorance. For the day of ſuſpenſion was paſt neer half an year before your 28th. of <hi>January</hi> 89, <hi>viz.</hi> on the beginning of the precedent <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and the time neer drawing on your 28th. of <hi>January</hi> was the Day of Deprivation in the beginning of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>February.</hi> But the time, that I was ſpeaking of from the admiſſion of their Majeſties in <hi>Feb.</hi> 88, till the day of ſuſpenſion in the <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, during which interval theſe Biſhops were in full unſuſpended juriſdiction. But in that time upon all incidental occaſions of colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inſtitutions to Eccleſiaſtical Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Oath of preſent Allegiance was to be miniſtred by the ordinary and primary Officer of the Biſhops, and by no others, while they were preſent at their Sees, except by their eſpecial Deputation. So that were there no particular inſtance producible for me, the truth, which I Spake, is ſelf-evident and notorious, that the Oath was adminiſtred in all ſuch Caſes by the Biſhops, or their Deputies. For no perſon, or power could herein impoſe any officer upon them, while all the Courſe of Eccleſiaſtical affairs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded yet in their names. But I know where deputations were then given, and the Oath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by thoſe Deputies by virtue of that Deputation. And is it not a very pertinent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the contrary, to tell me, what was done juſt before, and then after the day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, to diſprove what I had ſaid was done by the Biſhops before their actual Suſpenſion? And was it not very accurate to miſtake the days of Suſpenſion and Deprivation for one and the ſame, between which there was half a year diſtance? But there had been no occaſion for your reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Talent againſt the Reverend Fathers of

                        <p>This I often and very expreſly told you, that as to the merits of Deprivation, they ſtand in the enormities of your practic principles againſt the preſent Civil Conſtitution, by which you are brought into an incapacity of a public Truſt over mens Conſciences, which your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions will ſharpen into Civil Seditions, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Schiſms. And as to the Canonical form of your Deprivations, I placed it in the cuſtomary right, the ancient Churches uſed againſt Biſhops of falſe principles, by ſeparating from them, and Appealing to other Social Churches, and Biſhops for their aſſiſtance in new Conſecrations; which courſe our Church has alſo uſed againſt the Recuſant Fathers, upon the juſt Commands of the State.</p>

                           <hi>and it might have made an excellent Argument for</hi> Julian, <hi>or</hi> Diocleſian, by traducing our Biſhops as impoſturous, and comparing them to Idolaters, for which my friend <hi>T. B.</hi> hath ſo ſufficiently requited you, (Sec. Lett. pag. 36)

                        <p>Well; I think it not decent for us to draw hard on this invidious ſubject; let us, if you pleaſe, diſcuſs the Canonical forms of your procedure herein, which your party generally defends from pretended precedents of Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities over the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High Prieſts, and the Practice of Chriſtian Churches in ſubmiſſion to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102364:102"/>Imperial Orders, eſpecially the <hi>Greek</hi> Church under <hi>Turkîſh</hi> Changes made in their Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal See. Now the moſt famous inſtance among the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High Prieſt is that of <hi>Solomons</hi> depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Abiathar.</hi> Which tho' you endeavoured to parallel to our preſent Caſe, yet herein <hi>I brought you ſuch juſt exceptions, as neither you, nor all your Party will be able to take off. For if the Crime was nothing like, if there was ſuch a difference between the Conſtitutions of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>and</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Churches, if it was a manifeſt Ceſſion on</hi> Abiathar's <hi>part, (all which I well proved) then that Inſtance can by no means come up to this Caſe.

                           <hi>this perhaps may be the Plea of our Adverſaries, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the examples of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>High-Prieſt, that the Office of a Biſhop amonſt us is much more Spiritual, than the Office of thoſe High-Prieſts. To that Plea I anſwer, that he that conſiders the true and full import of the Queſtion now before us, will find it to be no other than this, whether a Perſon, duly inveſted with an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Office of God's own Inſtitution and Ordinance, being depoſed by the Lay-power, any other can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſucceed in that Office? Now as to God's parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inſtitution and Appointment, whatſoever otherwiſe the difference may be, (which is needleſs for us to contend about) it is certain, that the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>High-Prieſts were rather ſuperior than inferior to our Biſhops. 'Twas by God himſelf, and that too in an extraordinary manner, that the Office of the High-Prieſt was inſtituted, and it was from God alone that he received his Authority. If therefore a Perſon was accepted by God as a true and real High-Prieſt, tho' put into the room of another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Civil Authority, then a Biſhop likewiſe may be truly a Biſhop, and accordingly ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, tho' put into the place of a Biſhop depoſed by that Power. To this I add, that the annual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for the Sins of the whole People was to be performed by the High-Prieſt. This was the chief
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102364:103"/>of the federal Rites of that Religion, and that to which our Saviour's offering himſelf up a Sacrifice is particularly compared in the Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrews. <hi>And this they did</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>ſo that it was of the greateſt Conſequence to the</hi> Jews <hi>to have this Divine Inſtitution performed by one appointed to it by God. And tho' no proviſion was made for Caſes of neceſſity, yet neceſſity was underſtood to be a proviſion for it ſelf. And it is certain, theſe annual Expiations were accepted of God till our Saviour's days. For that is a certain Conſequence of their being ſtill in Covenant with God, ſince theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations were the yearly renewing of that Covenant. Nor can any of the performances of the Christian Prieſthood be compared to this, unleſs we believe the Power of Tranſubſtantiating. Theſe examples of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>High-Prieſt alone, were there no other to be alledged, would ſufficiently warrant our ſubmiſſion to our preſent Poſſeſſors.</hi>

                        <p>This Doctrine of that learned Doctors is very new, and amazing in every Sentence of it, as alſo is his original Principle. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of ſincere Metal, or no, muſt be tried by the proper Touchſtone. Firſt then it is ſtrange, that he ſhou'd affirm it certain, that the High-Prieſts are rather Superior to our Biſhops as to the Divinity of their Inſtitution. For are not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops inſtituted originally by God himſelf, and in a manner more extraordinary than that of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Conſecration? For this appears indeed in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Law to be divinely ſolemn, and glorious, as far as external Pomp and Ceremony could adorn it, and an Oracular Power of Judgment in things Temporal ſanctifie him, but yet as the Agent for God in this Conſecration was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant only, <hi>viz. Moſes,</hi> ſo the Oracular Sanctity
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102364:103"/>was not purely Spiritual. But the firſt Biſhops were the Apoſtles, made ſo, not by the Hand of a Servant, but the Son of God himſelf in our own Fleſh, ordaining them with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Power of Miracles of all kinds, with the inſufflation of the Holy Ghoſt, in order to the remiſſion, and retaining of ſins upon the Soul, by the Acts of an Authority to be ratified in Heaven. To them the Sacraments were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Laver of Regeneration, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Incorporation into Chriſt, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of his Holy Spirit, beſides the glorious Effuſion of the Spirit on them at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> conſecrating them Preachers of the Reſurrection of Chriſt with an amazing Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the ſight of all Nations gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in a manner more ſuperlative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divine than any the meaner Forms of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Inveſtiture. Beſides the Doctor may as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Inſtitution of the meaneſt <hi>Levites</hi> to that of the Higheſt Apoſtles upon the ſame grounds, on which he hath ſo ſuperexalted the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pontiff, who was no more divinely inſtituted than the loweſt Orders of <hi>Levi,</hi> tho' he was to higher Services. Nor is the Doctor leſs miſtaken in his extraordinary Eſteem, and Elogy of the Annual Expiation, as more noble than any Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Functions. For notwithſtanding all its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities and Operations, yet its higheſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was but Typical of that Grace, which was not given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by Jeſus Chriſt. And all its actual preſent Energy reached no further than a legal imaginary Cleanſing of the Body of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and this only for one Year paſt, and that only for the ſecuring him in the Temporal benefits promiſed in that Law. But our Prieſtly Functions are not merely Typical
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102364:104"/>of Grace not yet given, but both commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and exhibitory alſo of that Grace, which hath already appeared for the Salvation of all Men, and conſecrates the Souls and Bodies of Men unto Immortality; not to mention the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Meaſure of the Spirit collated in the eſpecial Acts of Epiſcopal Ordinations. In all which interiour Sanctifications, tho' there is no Tranſubſtantiation, yet is there a myſtical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Chriſt and his Members by the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating Communion of the Holy Spirit. For which truth it is needful that we contend, tho' I confeſs it was needleſs for him to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. And yet further, ſuppoſing all this had been right, which the Doctor hath dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet here ariſes another Infelicity in his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic. For tho' God might admit an intruded High-Prieſt, yet it does not follow, that Men may admit an intruded Biſhop; for can Man pretend to all the Authorities of God? God is indeed ſuperior to all his own Inſtitutions, and may diſpenſe with them, or ratifie Violations of them, as he did the violent Succeſſions in the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But does it follow, that Men can lawfully, without any Divine Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation given and granted, admit the Violations of his Laws, and the perverters of that Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which he has made organical to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Salvation of his Church? Nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, the Doctor is very unaccurate in his very State of the Queſtion, which properly is not, whether any Man may lawfully ſucceed an Eccleſiaſtic depoſed by a Lay-power; for if we grant that there can be any ſuch Lay-depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, no doubt the Succeſſion may be lawful; but the Queſtion is, whether there can be any Eccleſiaſtical Depoſition inflicted on Spiritual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102364:104"/>by a Lay-power? This is that we, and our Fathers complain of, that the Lay-powers enact Spiritual Cenſures of Suſpenſion, and Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which your Eccleſiaſtics admit as regular, and valid, which were they ſo, we ſhould not quarrel at the Succeſſions. This I am ſure is our Queſtion, whatſoever that of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> Treatiſe is; if this differs from ours; then in that reſpect the Treatiſe is impertinently adduced in our Caſe. Beſides the Queſtion is not, whether a Perſon duly inveſted with an Eccleſiaſtic Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of God's Inſtitution may not be depoſed by any Lay power? For if God in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church did ſubject their Eccleſiaſtics to a Lay-depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no doubt in the Nature of the thing it might be lawful. But the Queſtion is, whether firſt God did ſo ſubject the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Eccleſiaſtics to ſuch a Lay-authority? And ſecondly, ſuppoſing that God had ſo ſubjected their Eccleſiaſtics, the next Queſtion is whether he hath in like manner ſo ſubjected the Chriſtian Hierarchy? For if there be any ſpecific Difference, or intentional Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Nature and Purpoſes of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religions, if there have been ſuch Changes admitted by God in the Authorities of one, which have not been ſo conceded upon the Authorities of the other, then the Argument from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> doth not conclude upon the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Hierarchy. And therefore by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's leave, not only the Divinity of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but the Nature of the Offices, and the Rules of Tenure, and Succeſſion inſtituted by God in his Church, are to be conſidered in this Debate. For to put the matter into a ſhort Theory, I think it fairly poſſible to conceive, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, in what it was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> was only of a carnal Sanctity, in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102364:105"/>Order only to Temporal Fruitions, and ſo might be under the Conduct of Temporal Powers, that are the Supreme Guardians of all Temporal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion is purely Spiritual, not ſubordinated to Temporal Ends, and ſo not under the like Authority of Temporal Powers. Now whatſoever are the civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities about matters Chriſtian, I ſuppoſe the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Differences of our Religion from the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> will bar the Argument for the ſame Rules of Subjection. And if you pleaſe upon another Conſultation to propoſe the matter to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's ſecond Thoughts, I will be at the pains of repeating my Obſervations hereupon. <note n="†" place="margin">Sol. and Ab.

                           <hi>Firſt, that the whole Inſtitution of the</hi> Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Law was not of a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but carnal Sanctity, yielded them by God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in oppoſition, and ſomewhat in conformity to the Aegyptian, or other foreign Religions, among whom the Prieſthood had been long ſubjected to, and perhaps firſt inſtituted by the Scepter. And herein the Supreme Judgments in Civils upon the Law, and Oracular Reſponſes upon Conſultations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Peace, War, and Temporal Actions, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, were eſſential to the Authority of the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate. And yet we find this High-Prieſt not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any ordinary Power, till Kings were alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this People after the manner of the Nations, among whom the Mitre was ſubject to the Crown. All which put together makes</hi> Abiathar<hi>'s Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a Temporal Power under that Conſtitution Legal. But from the beginning it was not ſo. Then there were Prieſts who till the Flood had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, without any Civil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Power; and that Prieſthood was in all its Intentions Spiritual. So that when our Saviour
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102364:105"/>came not only to reſtore, but even to refine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the primitive Rules, he reſtored the Prieſthood from</hi> Vaſſalage, <hi>and founded his Hierarchy, not in Princes, but Apoſtles, not inarmed, but in unarmed Powers.</hi> But if among the Nations of old the carnal Prieſthoods were ſubject to Arbitrary and Imperial Powers, and God conceded the <hi>Jews</hi> Kings with ſuch Power after that Gentile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High-Prieſts thereupon became Subject, not only to a Judicial, but Imperial Authority, and ſo legally deprivable at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſecular Prince, ſo far at leaſt, that theſe Cenſures might be effectually valid, tho' not always good, and juſt. And hence all the Changes of the High-Prieſts, violently and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily made by heathen Princes in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pontificate, ſeem to be legally and regularly valid, <hi>ex jure Imperii toties quoties,</hi> and ſo are nothing at all to the Caſe of an uncanonical Deprivation, or the Doctor's purpoſe. But our Prieſthood has nothing Civil in it, nor is by God ſubjected to the Arbitrary Empire of Princes, that ſo we ſhould think our ſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bow down our Faith and Freedom to ſuch feeble Principles of Spiritual Bondage and Puſillanimity.</p>

                        <p>What I delivered then can well conſiſt with my preſent Sentiments, which I offer not in an itch of contradicting the Doctor, but upon the reaſonableneſs of the thing it ſelf. For in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s time the Genealogies were extant, and the due courſe of Succeſſion obvious; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I take it, <hi>Zadok</hi> had before in <hi>David</hi>'s time been admitted under <hi>Abiathar</hi> into the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Offices of the Pontificate, in order perhaps to the next plenary Succeſſion after the death of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> which Succeſſion now commenced on <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s remove before the time preintended, by the actual introduction of him by King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> into the poſſeſſion of what he had an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Title to upon the next vacancy, either by the right of Primogeniture, which the antient <hi>Jews</hi> have owned, from the firſt Patriarchs, and the Law <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.32. or upon an ordination by the Eccleſiaſtic Powers of the Sanhedrin, as men of <hi>Talmudic</hi> learning have conjectured. Now it is certain, that their native Kings of God's own appointment were obliged to keep the Law, and every man's Rights eſtabliſhed by it, and the doing otherwiſe was really ſinful and offenſive, tho' ſuch unjuſt acts of Kings had among them the <hi>effectum juris,</hi> as appears in the ſentence of <hi>David</hi> between <hi>Ziba</hi> and <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> If therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> had rejected <hi>Zadok</hi> as well as <hi>Abiathar,</hi> ſuch cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs procedure in my opinion had been unjuſt, but yet valid, as being not ſubject to any Tribunal, and preſumable for juſt, and done upon reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, although ſecret Cauſes. But when the Sovereignty fell into the hands of gentile Princes, not tyed to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Conſtitutions, as their native Kings were, and the Genealogies were loſt, and the Legal Succeſſors unknown, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

Does not this argue the Depoſition of ſuch a one null? and yet upon neceſſity God permitted the <hi>Jews</hi> to own the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor coming in by mere intruſion.</p>

                        <p>To this I anſwer, that if God himſelf allowed the <hi>Jews</hi> to admit ſuch intruders, then it appears, that it was not of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the <hi>Jews</hi> to have the Expiation perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102364:107"/>by one, to whom it belonged by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Law. For if the Intruders Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were effectually acceptable, they did the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as well as the Liturgy of the legal Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But further, Gods admiſſion of the Intruder after Intruſion takes off his irregularity, ratifies his Title, and vacates that of the ejected, and ſo is of Gods particular occaſional appointment for the time being, tho' not by the original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the Law, and ſo this is nothing to the Drs. Hypotheſis, or Cauſe. And this is in fact the real ſtate of that Caſe in ſuch Changes. The State Civil firſt intruded Succeſſors into the room of the expelled, but this not creating any Plenitude, or Sanctity of Title, God made up this defect by giving the Intruders the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which ſupervening made them alſo Gods high-prieſts to all Sacred, as well as Civil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Which act of Gods was not a mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their antecedent Authority, but an efficient thereof to all the intents of the Levitic Law, tho' the Dr. would fain perſwade us to a contrary notion herein. Yet had it been a mere conſequent acknowledgment of their Prieſt hood held only by Intruſion, as <note n="*" place="margin">Caſe of Sees <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ch. <hi>3.</hi> § <hi>3.</hi>
                           </note> the Dr. intimates, it had been nothing to his purpoſe, becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Extinction of the Genealogies, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the lineal Heirs, and the more plenary Subjection therefore of that pontificate to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Sovereigns, who were deſpotic, and free from all the ordinary Rules, that obliged their native Kings, this had made theſe Changes of High-Prieſts in the potificate (being an office car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and temporal even in its Religious acts) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally valid, and authoritative, for that theſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> powers came into the Sovereignty of their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102364:107"/>native Kings, (or perhaps a greater) to whom God at their requeſt had ſubjected the Hierarchy after the manner of the Nations. And a great deal of this I told you <note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. pag. <hi>24.</hi>
                           </note> in our laſt Conference, which no doubt you conſulted your Dr. upon. tho' he takes no notice of it. And I then drop'd another note perhaps worth a ſecond Rumen with you, <hi>that thoſe Intruſions, tho' thus admitted by God, were ſigns of a broken Church and State, haſtening to its laſt Diſſolution, and ſo no juſt Precedent for the Chriſtian Church to follow, which is to continue to the End of all things, except we muſt yield to methods of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that lead to our Extinction.</hi> And I leave it to the pious conſideration of every Religious Conſcience to judge whether thoſe ſervile Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to Imperial violences in the inſtances of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> Treatiſe, and the others produced by the Learned Dr. againſt his Opponents, did not properly lead to the ruin of the Church, into which the <hi>Greeks</hi> from theſe precedents are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under Mahometan powers? all which had been effectually obviated, had the Church ſtuck to the Laws and Canons of the Chriſtian Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and Communion againſt the encroachments of wicked Emperors, againſt which it is the Duty of all Churches, <hi>obſtare principiis,</hi> in contempt of perſecutions. Hereby, and hereby alone ſhall we be able to ſtifle all Eraſtian and Antichriſtian Arts, with which their concomitant perſecutions will all ceaſe and ſink of Courſe, when once men ſee we ſcorn them. For Shame, Conviction, and Reproach of Conſcience, upon the ſenſe of our magnanimous and meek Patience, will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quench the Spirit of perſecution, and open a glorious liberty and venerable Authority to the Church of God. But our baſe fears of worldly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102364:108"/>greatneſs on one hand, and the baſer affectation of it on the other, hath univerſally effaced all the glories of Religion and Piety throughout the world, and looks like a gloomy prognoſtic of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Ruines and Confuſion.</p>
                        <p>But that<note n="†" place="margin">This is the ſtrain of Dr. <hi>Hody</hi>'s great adverſary.</note> Clergy men themſelves ſhould court and invite an Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical ſervitude, and apply the bowſtring to the throat of their holy Mother, by Principles contrived to ſtrangle all her Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Powers and Authorities, is ſuch a daring preſumption, as needs a greater than the annual Expiation. And if the Dr. ſhould live to ſee his Principles purſued, by either Civil, or Tyrannical Powers to the arbitrary Subverſions of Gods Prieſts, or if otherwiſe he ſhall live to think fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly of that moſt holy Authority veſted in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops by God himſelf, whoſe Ambaſſadours, Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, and Repreſentatives they are, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of whom affronts even Chriſt himſelf, he will not think every violent Intruder, that like a Robber comes not in by the door, to be a regular Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, and that the moſt audacious Sacriledge hath entitled him to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Character, and conſecrated his Authority and Communion. He will then with ſighs and unappeaſable groans of Spirit anathematize the inſtances and deſign of his Baroccian Treatiſe, and the ill uſe of his own infinite reading, and diligence, to recommend the baſeneſs and villanies of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous Churches, concerning which at preſent I leave him and his Adverſaries to fight it out at Argument.

                        <p>'Tis ſtrange, that ſo Learned a man could fancy this to be an anſwer, eſpecially ſince I ſee not how he can clear himſelf from inconſiſtency, or open error. For if it were a poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> as he grants, how could it be an abſolute Deprivation, which he aſſerts? I owned it to be a command as poſitive and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as the Dr. but for that very reaſon denyed it to be a proper Act of Judicial Deprivation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe judicial Sentences are not direct commands on the Offenders to excuſe their own puniſhments, but decrees of puniſhments to be executed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, as in <hi>Joabs</hi> Caſe, which ſo apparently differs in Form from this of <hi>Abiathar.</hi> Beſides a command of ſelf-execution, as it may actually,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102364:109"/>ſo may it lawfully be diſobeyed, and rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and it is in any ſuch mans choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will ſubmit to it, or no; and the truth is, no man will yield thereto, but for fear of greater Danger. Now if there had been no other proſpect of Danger, <hi>Abiathar</hi> would not have obeyed this ſo poſitive command of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and if he had not actually obeyed, the mere command, being fruſtrate by his neglect, had not been an abſolute Deprivation; that then, which in it ſelf was no abſolute Deprivation without <hi>Abiathars</hi> conſent, and obedience, which was not alone ſo, as the Dr. contends, and his office became void by Ceſſion, not mere Deprivation. For it is a great miſtake in the Dr. to imagine that poſitive commands deſtroy Option. For tho' the commands of God upon our Practices are all as abſolute as poſſible, yet are they propoſed to our option. Thus, ſaith God, in his * <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy, Ch. 30. v. 19. I ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing; therefore chooſe life, that thou and thy ſeed may live.</hi> The Law and Goſpel, though in the preceptive part they are moſt properly Laws, yet have alſo, the nature, and form of a Covenant in them and the puniſhments inflicted by vertue of them are juſtified, not only from the nature of the crimes, but our own option. But let us ſee, whether this command were ſo poſitive as theſe Laws? whether it were ſo much the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Kings own will, as a conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive indulgence to the will of <hi>Abiathar?</hi> It is plain then herein K. <hi>Solomon</hi> offered him an eaſier condition than his crime deſerved, tho' the Dr. to ſerve his Hypotheſis extenuates the guilt of his Rebellion. And if this be in fact ſo, then it ſeems rather a Conceſſion with a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102364:110"/>mixture of Counſel, than a mere auſtere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Retirement; for ſo verbs of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative Mood very ordinarily ſignifie, and <hi>Solomons</hi> kind reflection on his Liturgies, and Sufferings in the days of <hi>David</hi> fairly appear to intend ſo much. If a Traytor were thus ſpoken to by his Prince; <hi>never ſee my face more; get the out of this place, for this ſhall ſatisfy me inſtead of thy forfeited life;</hi> or [elſe] thou art a dead man even to day, the Traytor would interpret the receſſion to be a condition of Life, rather than a precept of Civil Duty.

                        <p>Will not the College of Biſhops, and the body of the Clergy think it Eſſential to Chriſtian Religion to preſerve the Hierarchy and Authority of the Prieſts Sacred, and inviolate againſt all routs and tyrannical confuſions?

For put the Caſe in Fact, that once again an O.

                        <p>You ought here to obſerve, that our Queſtion runs about the Duty, or Lawfulneſs of admitting Intruders, upon an open and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Expulſion of Right, not where the Title, or Right is dubitable. Now when an Intruder conteſts for the holding an Eccleſiaſtical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the Rightful Proprietor, that is invalidly and uncanonically thruſt out, doth the Law of God leave it to our Wiſdom, and not to our Juſtice to determine, or does it leave it to our Wiſdom, to determine according to regular and confeſſed Juſtice, or according to irregular and confeſſed Wrong? For the Law of God requires us to render <hi>ſuum cui<expan>

                           </hi> every Man his due, and there is no Wiſdom againſt Right. But the Phraſe of leaving things to our Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom imports a Liberty undetermined by God, which we may uſe as we judge expedient, and what God hath ſo left by the Silence of his Word, is under no Divine Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by this Law we are at liberty to take, or chooſe whether of the two Competitours we in our Wiſdom think moſt convenient to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102364:114"/>the good of the Church, and hereupon as many violent Competitors, as any Illegal Rout ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude againſt Right, may draw after them ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral Parties, according as they in their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Wiſdom ſhall determin. And is this the way of Eccleſiaſtick Peace, Unity, and Happineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the danger of exteriour Perſecutions? For if force ſhall put in Competitions, I doubt the Competitions muſt be ended by force; where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Wiſdom cannot fix a determinate Unity. But the Eighth and Tenth Commandments expeſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid men to take, or covet anothers Right, and leave us no liberty to determin otherwiſe. So that no man ought to intrude into anothers Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick. For a Deprivation, that is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invalid, cuts off no Right, or Title before Rightly, and Authoritatively veſted. And he ſins whoſoever puts himſelf into poſſeſſion of ſuch Right, which is canonically permanent in the former Poſſeſſor. Had the Emperors pretended a Deprivation of the Apoſtles Epiſcopacy, had it been lawful for any other Biſhop to have rejected them, or ſeized their Archiepiſcopacy and have ſubjected the Apoſtles to their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government? Or will the fear of force neceſſitate a Man to admit an injurious conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another Divine Authority? But what ſhall be done, if no Biſhops will confer the Sacred Order on him? What muſt they be alſo obliged by a Rout to give the Holy Ghoſt to qualify the Intruder? If not, then this is what they may refuſe to ſacrifice to the preſent ſecular Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the Church. And if the Biſhops may refuſe to ordain, a man may refuſe to be ordained to an Intruſion, becauſe it is an Intruſion: And if ſo, the whole Church may refuſe the Intruſion. But if the Biſhops are obliged hereto for fear of force, then even the injured Biſhops may be bound to conſecrate others into their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102364:115"/>deprived Authorities; and ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had likewiſe been obliged againſt their own Divine Commiſſion. But if this be allowed, the reſult will really be, that the Apoſtles, and all Biſhops Authority either actually ceaſes, or ought to be quitted by their own Ceſſion, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, at the command of mere Force; out then the producer is not invalid, unjuſt or uncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in the Ejection, and conſequently agrees not with the Drs. Hypotheſis. But God, that is a God of order, not of confuſion, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the deturbation of <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor the Subſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Intruder by the Mob, or Princes: <hi>Numb.

For they had other Senſes, and Wiſdom, when they ſo ſeverely provided againſt ſuch forcible Entries by the 30th. Canon Apoſtolick; <hi>If any Biſhop, (ſay's that Holy Canon) making uſe of worldly Princes, does by them get himſelf poſſeſſed of a Church, let him be Deprived, and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and all that Communicate with him.</hi> Now if neceſſity vacates the obligations of all Canons, not excepting thoſe of Epiſcopal Conſtitutions; how came theſe Wiſe Men of the Eaſt to make a Canon againſt irreſiſtible neceſſity, if the terrour of Temporal Perſecution be ſuch? And why does <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and other Fathers object this Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Arian</hi> Intruders? For if there were no fault in the Intruſion, but only the Arianiſm, then thoſe Fathers ought only to have upbraided them with the Arianiſm, not the Intruſion. But if the Fathers juſtly condemn the Intruſion, then they were not to admit what they righteouſly cenſured. And if the Fathers were not to admit Intruſions, neither were the people to admit them,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102364:115"/>for by ſo doing they would become accomplices to the Evil, and for that cauſe are Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by the ſaid Apoſtolick Canon. And what I pray has the Doctor to evince the contrary?</p>

Who makes a difference there between a Competent, and Incompetent Authority? Why does the Oath, which he took to the Rightful Lord, ceaſe to oblige him? 'Tis becauſe, when he took the Oath, he took it only on this Suppoſition, that the Lord was poſſeſſed of the Mannor. The Peace, and Tranquillity of the Publick, and the good of Tenants in general give that Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Oath.</hi> Now here I muſt ſet you upon the Dr. who would never allow forcible Entry,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102364:116"/>or Poſſeſſion to be legal, or valid, and thereupon aſſert the Reſiſtance of <hi>O. C.</hi> to be juſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Drs. Principles juſtifie the Engagement to his Government againſt King and Houſe of Lord's. But now for the preſent I will aſſume your Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reply upon the Dr. Firſt of all, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Conqueſts a Publick Settlement gives a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal form of Title; and ſecondly in a Government full ſettled there cannot be an Unlawful Court, nor can any Man be ejected by an Incompetent Court, if he will legally except againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competency. Otherwiſe, if an <hi>Alien</hi> get in by a mere Formal Rout of Robbers, the Tenant owes him no Duty, and pays it on Peril of Repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Penalty to the Legal Proprietor; And Men are always wary upon the Competitions of ſeveral pretending Landlords to be ſecured in their Payments from the other Claimers, from which they know the mere preſent Poſſeſſion is not a Legal Security always. But beſide, this is not a Parallel Caſe; nor is there the ſame parity of Reaſon in a Real Eſtate, and the Perſonal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Here is a Man, that really was, and ſtill Aſſerts himſelf Chriſt's Ambaſſador, Reſidentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vicar, and Vice-gerent; Comes a Tyrant, or a Rout, and violently expells this Ambaſſador; This is a Crime againſt the Laws of Nations, and the Rights of Royal Majeſty, and is a direct affront to our Lord Chriſt. But this is not all; This Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or Rout corrupts a few of other our Lord's Miniſters, and they in their Lord's name give Credential Commiſſions to an impoſtor ſet up by theſe Enemies of our Lord, to ſupply the defect of the ejected Ambaſſador; this augments ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not leſſens the inſolence, and no Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can connive thereat without ſevere and vindicative Reſentments. Now whether ſhall the Church own for Chriſt's Meſſenger, him that he ſent, but others barbarouſly, expelled, or him,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102364:116"/>that he ſent not, but others impudently obtruded? Doth not our Saviour ſay to them, whom he ſent, as his Father ſent him, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Shall outward force force us into Inteſtine Schiſm, or Diſorder, or can no Diviſion from our Fathers be Schiſmatical ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for fear of Temporal force? But one thing more will I ask the Dr. whether we muſt admit ſuch Depoſition, as violent Power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, before a new violent filling of the Sees with others? If not, then are we not to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all the Secular Peace, and then the See being not vacant by ſuch pretended Depoſition, either the Depoſition formally conſiſts in the new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, and ſo the Intruſion muſt on the Drs. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis be invalid, and ſo cannot oblige us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; or if the Intruſion be not the Depoſition, then the former Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not Depoſed, and the latter, either is not poſſeſſed, or two Anti-Biſhops can be, and are joyntly poſſeſſed of the ſame Epiſcopal See, and Authority. But if we
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102364:117"/>may, or muſt abide by the pretended Secular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition before a new Intruder; then what if the Secular Tyranny will not concede us any Biſhop? Muſt we Sacrifice here too? No, here the Dr. is tender, and will not Sacrifice, he will have ſome Biſhop, or other by Mr. Mobs favour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Irreſtibleſhip will, or no. Now then let us reduce this Prudential Principle into Practice, and if you can bear a little teizing, I will diſcuſs its Virtue.</p>

                        <p>I ſmell your deſign well enough to bring me into a ſnare; but I can anſwer the Dr. upon your Principles. For if the Conqueror be not ſettled in Form of Law, all he does is of no Validity, and the Clergy are to have no regard to his violences upon the Biſhop, nor his Illegal intruſion of another. But if he upon Conqueſt hath attained to a Formal Settlement, there is a juſt Cauſe, on the Merits of which, the Recuſant Biſhop at the Command of the Conqueror, may be ejected by the Church, and give way to a Succeſſor of the Conquerors Nomination. But this the Church is obliged to, not for mere wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake towards the reaſon of the Cauſe, and the Law of God, that requires Subjection to humane Conſtitutions. But the Drs.

                        <p>Does Baniſhment, Impriſonment, or Captivity, cutting off all capacity of commerce, vacate the See, and exauctorate the injured Biſhop?</p>

                        <p>It does render the See actually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty for the time; but yet I will allow you, that the Biſhop is not exauctorated, but that upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the impediments, his Authority would immediately exert it ſelf, and run on in its old Channel, and ought to be received on the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Title, as being ſtill Biſhop of his Dioceſe, except his ſuppoſed prohibition of another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute

                        <p>This is odd Doctrine; If the Biſhop does not forbid the Church to ſubſtitute another, which not to do may be preſumed for a Ceſſion, then he ſtill continues Biſhop; if he forbids a Subſtitution, then he quits it by forfeiture; I pray how can you make out theſe Paradoxes?</p>

                        <p>Thus; if a Biſhop ſhall enjoyn Orders to the Diſſolution of Diſcipline, he <hi>ipſo facto</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes irregular, and forfeits. And ſuch would be the effect of this ſuppoſed Prohibition of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute. But if he admits a Subſtitute upon the neceſſity of Diſcipline not otherwiſe to be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he ſtill continues Biſhop, and is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for ſuch in full Authority immediately upon his enlargment, and recovery.</p>

                        <p>This does not extricate, but involve, and double the Paradox. For thus there may be two Biſhops of the ſame See at once, and a Succeſſor to a preſent Proprietary; which Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor is to be again thruſt out as uncanonical, and no Biſhop of ſuch Dioceſe on the return of the former.</p>

                        <p>Two Biſhops there then will be at the ſame time of one and the ſame See, though not in it. But the ſecond will not be a proper Succeſſor, but a Sagan, or Vicar to the abſent, and ſo to give place to the returning Proprietary, till the See ſhall become wholly vacant of the Proprietary Biſhop by death, or otherwiſe, except there be ſome other exceptive proviſion in ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Caſes.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102364:119"/>deſerts, and unknown Fields for many years, not plainly renouncing his Station however.

But ſo it happen'd, that after the death of the third intermediate Biſhop <hi>Gordius, Narciſſus</hi> returns, and the Church requires him to reſume the Throne Epiſcopal, not on a new, but his old Title. But becauſe through the great infirmities of his old Age he could not bear the fatigue of his Office, it was agreed, that one <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſhould be his Sagan, or Partner in that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, the original Authority of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> being thus derived to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and by him to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in eaſe to <hi>Narciſſus.</hi>

                        <p>Why, look ye; Deprivation, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102364:120"/>in our Senſe, and Caſe, is the Divorce, or Diſſolution of the ſpiritual Relation between Prieſt and People, but Baniſhment, Impriſonment, and Captivity makes no ſuch divorce; And this the Dr. Fundamentally grants in ſuppoſing his Lay-ejections to be invalid Deprivations, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and though he generally calls theſe Lay-ejections, and Baniſhments by the name of Depoſitions, yet upon a cogent pinch he grants, that Baniſhment from a Biſhoprick, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on purpoſe to part the Biſhop from his people, is no Depoſition; for ſo he<note n="†" place="margin">Caſe of Sees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ch. <hi>4.</hi> pag. <hi>56.</hi>
                           </note> expreſly aſſerts of <hi>S. Hilary, that he was never De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but only Baniſhed,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him to be ſtill actual Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> ſince there was no other Orthodox Biſhop there. Now our enquiry, as the Dr. ſets it, is of an unjuſt and invalid Depoſition by a Lay-power, or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Force, and the Admiſſion of a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor conſequent thereupon. Now if Baniſhment (and by parity of Reaſon Impriſonment, and Captivity) is not a Depoſition, how are theſe pertinently alledged for ſuch in our Queſtion? Then again, if upon Baniſhment the Depoſition conſiſts in the intruſion of another, and this be unjuſt, and invalid, how is the intruded a right Succeſſor to whom the Churches obedience is due? Or if he be not right, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Canonical) how is this obedience due? Muſt we pay obedience where it is not due? Or is there any due, where there is no form of Right? Or is there any form of Right created by an Act not only unjuſt, but even invalid, and conſequently null? Then again, every one of the Drs. inſtances of Lay-depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are nothing but meer Baniſhments, and Impriſonments, and ſo no Depoſitions from their Spiritual Powers or Relations, as he confeſſes in St. <hi>Hilaries</hi> caſe; though elſewhere he common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102364:120"/>calls them Depoſitions without thinking of it. But if the Depoſitions conſiſt in the conſequent intruſions, theſe being invalid, as well as unjuſt, oblige to nothing, but Repentance and Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſo his infinite expence of Reading and Criticiſm is all at once unfortunately thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But there is one thing farther conſiderable in the laſt Queſtion of the Dr. and that is the impoſſibility of performing the Epiſcopal Functions, conſequent to theſe Lay-Baniſhments and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments. For if this incapacity gives thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences the forms of Depoſitions, then it appears not, that all the Lay-inſtances produced by the Dr. were Depoſitions; and perhaps none of them, ſince the Epiſcopal conduct might be carried on by Communicatory Letters to the Dioceſes, and other Social Biſhops to act for them, according to the conſtant practice of Exiled and Impriſoned Biſhops from the days of the Apoſtles. But if the perſecution be ſo ſtraight as to preclude all capacity of ſuch Paſtoral care, a new Biſhop may be ſet to ſupply the defect, but not to exclude the Right of the ejected, to govern for him, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to reſign upon the return of the Proprietor. On this account it muſt be reſolved how the ejected Biſhops reteining their Claim or Right, mentioned by the Dr. or his Baroccian Treatiſe, owned thoſe Orthodox Perſons that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their places in their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

For their Mutual Friendſhip is a demonſtration, that <hi>John</hi> did not ſtill oppoſe <hi>Elias;</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ratified <hi>John</hi>'s Preſent Government by his Communion; which was, if not a Ceſſion, as your Vindicator conceived, yet a Valid Conceſſion for the time being. For tho' <hi>John</hi> was one of <hi>Elias</hi>'s Expellers, yet after <hi>John</hi> had oppoſed, and baffled the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and therein ſeconded <hi>Elias</hi>'s Cauſe: This, with the Mediation of thoſe Martial Monks <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Sabas,</hi> might cool all <hi>Elias</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reſentments, and procure his Peace, and Ratification of <hi>John</hi>'s Government. That <hi>Elias</hi> was not obliged by Canon to acquieſce is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, not only from many Canons to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the practice of many others produced by the Dr. who endeavoured to recover againſt the Orthodox Intruder received by the Church on the Drs. Fundamental Law of Neceſſity. If then <hi>Elias</hi> acquieſced not by Law, but Choice, this made a Ratifying Conceſſion to <hi>John</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hereupon <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Sabas</hi> might well Communicate with both, ſince they both held Communion one with the other, either by the Ceſſion, or Conceſſion of <hi>Elias.</hi> But here a ſhrew'd hard Queſtion Intervenes; If the Church always owned the Orthodox Poſſeſſor of anothers Chair without Schiſm, how could the Orthodox ejected Biſhop rival and conteſt the Intruded Poſſeſſor without Schiſm or injury done in challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; his Right, while yet his Right would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for quitted; if he ſhould not challenge it? Now during the Challenge he muſt renounce the Poſſeſſor, and all Communion with him as ſuch, whom yet the whole Church according to the Dr. lawfully receives for the Dioceſan: Now if the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102364:121"/>Ejected will be in the Communion of the whole Church, they muſt own their Anti-Biſhops, and ſo it will be their Duty to looſe their Right to Intruders, or if they may refuſe the Anti-Biſhops without Fault, how can others lawfully own them, and their Poſſeſſion of other Men's Sees ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver validly vacated? Methinks Apparent and Confeſſed Right ſhould obtain in Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poſſeſſion manifeſtly without Right; nor is it a Rule of Conſcience, or Religious Peace, but Carnal Fear, and baſe Intereſt, that inclines to the contrary. Hereupon I conclude, that the beſt <hi>Title, John</hi> had to the Churches Communion, was from the Conceſſion of <hi>Elias.</hi> And your Vindicator had great reaſon to ſuppoſe ſomething done on <hi>Elias</hi>'s part, to the confirming of <hi>John</hi>'s Prelacy; from the Communion, that is aſſerted to have been between them. For being appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently no Anti-Biſhops, the Natural and Legal Preſumption muſt be, that <hi>Elias</hi> allowed him, and that was a Canonical ground for the Churches regular Communion with him, tho' before there ſeems none, except <hi>Elias</hi> had been removed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Capacity of Communion, which it's plain he was not. So then it is not the Subſtitution of a New Biſhop in the Chair of another, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly latent, or removed from all poſſible Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that makes a Schiſm, but when one is ſet up to Exclude the other, (Violently and Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly Ejected) from the Adminiſtration of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, either at preſent, or hereafter, while in a Capacity, and Readineſs to perform his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Thus Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> whom the Dr. hath alſo inſtanced, pronounces it Unlawful for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to admit another Biſhop during his Life, and <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> alledges that Authority and Rule for Canonical and Good. Yet when he was Condemned at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had taken him for dead, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102364:122"/>ſo choſe <hi>Eugenius,</hi> no wonder that Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> receiving News of this before his death, prayed for <hi>Eugenius</hi> thus choſen, becauſe he knew the <hi>Romans</hi> had not ſet him up as an Anti-Biſhop, and could not doubt, had his return been poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that his Church, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> too, would have joyfully re-inthroned him. But in caſes of Competition, as in the <hi>Ignatian</hi> and <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> War, if the Church or the Competitors can be on both ſides excuſed from Schiſm, upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very turn and invalid Act of Lay-Power, againſt which a good and valid Title is ſtill aſſerted, while the people turn to both ſides with the Secular Wind, <gap reason="foreign">

Now if the ſtanding Councils of the Churches find the Biſhop wickedly ejected by the Secular Arm, or without any declared Cauſe, they ought not to admit any other Biſhop, without the conſent of, and during a capacity of Communication with the Ejected, or his Deputies.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102364:123"/>the Catholick Biſhop <hi>Meletius</hi> was ſettled in his See, upon which <hi>Euſtathius</hi> quitted his Epiſcopal Care and Government, and not before. Now from hence 'tis plain, that Civil Separations are not real Deprivations, or Depoſitions, and that the Admiſſion of an Heretical Intruder thereupon does not create a Deprivation of a Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop from his Church. So that all the Queſtion remaining herein is, whether the Introduction of an Orthodox Biſhop be an effectual Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? For if ſo, the Orthodox Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the New Orthodox Biſhop, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deprive the former Good, Perſecuted, Confeſſor Biſhop, but who can think, that an Orthodox Church will, or can do this according to the Rules of Orthodoxy? But, then again this is no Lay-Deprivation, and yet on the Drs. Hypotheſis muſt be Unjuſt, Invalid and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canonical, and yet, I pray, muſt it be done by an Orthodox Church according to the Rules of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy? Even ſo it muſt be according to the Drs. but not the Catholick Principles. But if the Church by the introduction of a New does not intend to deprive the Old, then the Old Biſhops Title and Relation to his Church is ſtill retained, and permanent, and the New is no Anti-Biſhop to the Old, but muſt reſign upon the return of the former, except it be otherwiſe Canonically contracted. And in the Drs. own inſtance, who can think, that the Catholick Church in <hi>Antioch</hi> by admitting <hi>Meletius</hi> did depoſe <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> to whom they ever had ſo firmly adhered du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the <hi>Arian</hi> Perſecution?

                        <p>In this point I find the Dr. and ſome of you very well agreed, to excuſe, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to juſtifie this Submiſſion in the Greek Church. This the Dr. obſerves in one of his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, and ſo have you and I in your learned Author of Chriſtian Communion. But herein my opinion is, that the whole Greek Church was culpable in the firſt Admiſſion of ſuch Changes, and ſtil is ſo in continuing ſuch ſubmiſſion, whic has nothing in it to Excuſe it but fear of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. It is true, it would be odd for one ſingle Patriarch to refuſe ſuch Ejection againſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and humour of the whole Church, eſpecially if himſelf were advanced ſo upon the Imperial Expulſion of his Predeceſſor; for if a whole Church will perverſely urge her Biſhop to yield
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102364:125"/>to violence, and lay down his Mitre, I think in many Caſes he may do well to yield to an unjuſt and inflexible importunity, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> did; but the Churches are to blame, that do not animate and maintain their Biſhops againſt ſuch Tyrannies in their Spiritual Authorities, which ought not to lacquey it to Simoniacal and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous inſolences. For ſince the Greek Churches are, as to their Temporal Condition, in the ſame State with the Primitive, they ought to do as the Primitive Church would have bravely done, and to follow the rules of Succeſſion, that were obſerved in thoſe pureſt Ages. It is true, the whole Greek Church, having by a long and conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſent and preſcription made this Uſage to themſelves, as it were Canonical, would not ſeem Schiſmatical in neglecting the claim of an Ejected Patriarch, becauſe he himſelf in his firſt advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came in by the pleaſure of the Sultan, and aſſumed the Patriarchate under the ſame ſervile Terms and Conditions. And therefore that firſt Conſent, tho' faulty, and vicious, incapacitates him to reform, and reverſe the ill cuſtom ſingly by himſelf, without the concurrence of his Epiſcopal Colleagues, or the general Councils of that Church; at leaſt he cannot condemn them as Schiſmatical in this Cuſtomary Servility. And here I muſt put this Quaere, whether this Submiſſion of the Greek Church to ſuch Changes be ſimply Sinful? If ſo, then the Dr. ought not to preſcribe from them, as exemplary, or excuſable. If not ſinful, then Cuſtom, and Eccleſiaſtical Conſent hath made thoſe deprivations and ſucceſſions Valid, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and then they are alien to the Drs. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, and are impertinently alledged. But as if Caſe of the Greek Church now actually ſtands, the ejected Patriarch making no challenges, 'tis no domeſtick Schiſm within themſelves, tho it be a wretched Dehoneſtation of that Churches
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102364:125"/>Sanctity. And ſo, if, as the Dr. confeſſes, <hi>theſe Patriarchs, do not merit by their Learning, or Wiſdom to be guides, and patterns to the Biſhops of</hi> England, he ſhould not urge us with their corrupt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane examples, to ſacrifice our Hierarchies to the arbitrary luſts of Secular Powers. For if it be not a formal Schiſm in the Greek, 'tis a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated vice and corruption there, and which for that reaſon we are to oppoſe, and prevent here againſt all imprudent perils, that it may not become an irremediable and common Evil.</p>

And then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Notion the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Deprivation <hi>ipſo facto</hi> muſt be taken as a Law upon the Church to reject the Recuſants totally from their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Here you will not have the Deprivation to proceed from the Act of the State alone, but, to ſave ſome Honour to the Clergy, you make their Deprivation valid by their Concurrence to the Act of Deprivation. But I pray, how did they concur? Was it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Act, when it was made? And is ſuch Submiſſion any Authority? I thought they had been quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things.

No, not a word; but when it is done, they ſubmit to it, and acknowledg it. And you would make a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation againſt Fact, that their Concurrence was neceſſary to it, that themſelves did not pretend, nor dare they do it to this day.—It is certain the Parliament thought their own Authority ſufficient to deprive the Biſhops, and did not ask, or think they needed the Concurrence of the Clergy to make their Act valid. On the contrary no Clergy-men have dared to diſpute it, but thoſe, who are deprived. And for others to imagin to come in by their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence into a ſhare of the Authority, is like the fly on a Wheel of the Chariot, that thought he contributed to the duſt that was raiſed, for he too gave his concurrence. It is poſſible ſuch Men as you ſhould not ſee how contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible it renders them, to pretend to an Authority they dare not avow? And upon this Foundation to raiſe Arguments to juſtify their proceedings, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain any other way!

But for you to upbraid me with my Candour, who are ſo heedleſs in attending to my words, as to take, or ſet them off in other Senſes, than ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally can be fixed on them in their clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Concurrence, is neither very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, nor prudential. Let us therefore again look over theſe overſights, and ſee whether we can come again to our ſelves. Firſt then I never ſaid, that the Concurrence of the Church was neceſſary, either to make an Act of Parliament, or to make it valid in Eccleſiaſticals, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Acts of Deprivation; But I admitted your Principle ſo far, and no further, that her Concurrence is neceſſary to give Statutes an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Effect, and Iſſue. For an Act of Parliament may juſtly require of the Church ſome certain Eccleſiaſtical proceedings, without any joynt Seſſion, or Conſultation of the Church. And ſuch Acts ſhall be juſt and valid of themſelves to oblige the Conſcience of the Church to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or executive Concurrence. As ſuppoſe, an Act of Parliament, repealing all the Statutes of Premunire, which cramp the liberties of the Church in the Epiſcopal Succeſſions, and Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Conſultations for a perfect reformation to a Primitive purity, ſhould conſequently require our Biſhops, or Convocations to proceed upon ſuch relaxation to provide, and execute better rules of Diſcipline on the morals, and duties of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church under their care, and to renew the <hi>Commercium formatarum</hi> with foreign Churches
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102364:127"/>for a general Reſtitution of Piety and Order to its Primitive State, ſuch a Law I think would valioly oblige the Church to Concurrence, without which however actually given it could not have its Eccleſiaſtical Effect. When King <hi>Joaſh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prieſts to employ the ſacred Money to the reparation of the Lords Houſe, it was a valid command to oblige; but while the Prieſts neglected it, it had no Sacred effect. 2 <hi>King</hi> 12. So when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake unto <hi>Aaron, Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Ithamar</hi> to eat the meat offering and heave ſhoulder according to ſet Rules, the precept was very valid, yet becauſe of their actual Omiſſion it wanted an Eccleſiaſtical Effect, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. So when a Statute of Deprivation requires the Church to eject Recuſants from their Stations, if the cauſe be neceſſary, or juſt, the Statute is valid to oblige the Conſcience of the Church to an executive and concurrent obedience, yet if the Church will by no means yield to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the State, whether juſt or unjuſt, valid or invalid in its obligatory intentions, it cannot actually paſs into an Eccleſiaſtical Effect, and Iſſue, and all, that the Civil Powers can do on the refuſal, is to ſubject the Church to temporal Puniſhments. Nay, in the ſame Genus of Civil Government the Decrees and Judgments of the Kings Courts, notwithſtanding their perfect juſtice and validity, cannot have their Civil Effect, if the ſubordinate officers neglect, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to execute them. Tis true, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Civil obligations of Under-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to their Superiors in Secular Authorities, and thoſe of the Church to the Civil Powers in matters Eccleſiaſtical. For that Civil Officers are obliged only to obſerve the Legal forms of proceſs in the Orders of their Superiors, and are not tied to enquire into the inner juſtice of thoſe Orders. But the Church, when under any Laws,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102364:128"/>or Commands of the State, may and ought to judge for her ſelf, and her conſcience toward God, Whether the matters, enjoyned her by the Laws, be conſiſtent with the Laws and Principles of Chriſtianity, and the Churches fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, againſt which ſhe is never to admit them to an Eccleſiaſtical Effect, but muſt bear the penal Conſequences with all meeknes and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And this is not only the Right and Duty of all Churches, as ſacred Corporations, toward all humane laws in matters moral, or Religious, but of every ſingle Chriſtian alſo. And if this be not admitted, up goes Hobbiſm, and the Civil Powers may enact Deprivations, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and Anathema's for mens refuſing the Alcoran, Paganiſm, Socinianiſme, and even Atheiſm it ſelf, and for owning the Scriptures, Creeds, and Sacraments. But you, that think us ſuch a ſoft and waxen generation, would have found this Right aſſerted even unto Martyrdom againſt all ſuch deprivations, had they been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon cauſes apparently injurious, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the Church. For in the late Reign not only you, but others alſo oppoſed the growth and menaces of Popery with a burning zeal, when we had no preſent proſpect of any thing, but Fagots, Dragons, and moſt Chriſtian Bridles. And that all theſe Armies of Worthies, ſhould all of a ſudden grow baſe, abject, and irreligious, cannot eaſily (I am ſure not fairly) be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But in caſes, which the Church judges equal, ſhe may concur and ſubmitt, and when ſhe may ſo do, it can be neither religious, or prudential to provoke, or incur a perſecution by a needles and obſtinate refuſal, which is our Senſe upon the Cauſes and Law of the preſent Deprivations. But is it not a pretty exception againſt this Concurrence, becauſe it is yielded by Submiſſion, not Authority? For did I ever
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102364:128"/>aſſert of an Authority in the Church to refuſe her Duty, againſt which certainly there lies no Authority? And I told you,<note n="†" place="margin">Sol. and Ab. pag. <hi>28.</hi>
                           </note> that the Church here concurs by Submiſſion, as judging it her duty herein to yield to the State. But in ſuch Caſes if you will needs require the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I will remind you what I told you<note n="†" place="margin">Sol. and Ab. Pag. <hi>29.</hi>
                           </note> laſt time, that <hi>the Church has an Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Right to judge in ſuch Caſes, whether ſhe may, or muſt concur, or no. And hence a Right eſſentially belongs to it to examin all the Cauſes of the Secular Demands; ſo that if ſhe finds there be no grave Reaſons to move the Church to the required Severities, ſhe ought to diſobey, as my Lord Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>well did, when required to ſuſpend Dr.</hi> Sharp indictâ Cauſâ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for this I alledged out of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> one of the Nobleſt Inſtances in all Antiquity, wherein the Biſhops of <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> refuſed to depoſe, or reject the canonically ſettled Biſhop of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> notwithſtanding all <hi>Julians</hi> terrors and commands, of which I wonder Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> took no notice. But I add alſo, that if the Church finds thoſe Cauſes ſufficient, ſhe may, if neceſſary ſhe muſt admit the Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing them, and not wantonly pretend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt duty, nor uſe her <hi>liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſs.</hi> And I can never imagine, that this Right of the Church was ever ſuſpected, much leſs oppoſed by any Powers or Legiſlators truly Chriſtian.</p>
                        <p>But if Civil Powers will make irreligious Laws in maters Spiritual, will you immediatly oblige the Chriſtian Councils to invade the Senate Houſe, or Courts of Civil Judicature with Proteſtations againſt their Procedures, before the Laws come home upon us, and preſs us to actual Concurrence? Surely the Primitive Chriſtians did not ſo againſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102364:129"/>the Edicts of Heathen Powers. For tho' Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity will warrant meek and petitionary Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, yet will it not juſtifie ſawcy Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Prohibitions upon Legiſlators, who muſt paſs undiſturbed and unaffronted in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and we muſt with all meekneſs of behaviour wait the eventual proſecution of the Laws, if we cannot divert it by fair atonement; and when it comes, refuſing calmly the required Sins, commit our ſelves, and Cauſe to <hi>him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> So that all your Harangues about running into Parliament Houſe with Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Proteſtations for <hi>our</hi> againſt <hi>their</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, are injudicious, immodeſt, and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious propoſals, tho' we had known the demands of the State to have been unlawful, which we yet acknowledge to be otherwiſe. And that we ſhould ceaſe to be a Church, becauſe we are not officiouſly rude to the Legiſlators, who may ſometimes happen to be cauſeleſly unkind, or hard hearted to us! We are neither to precipitate our zeal, manners, confeſſion, or ſufferings, but let the will of God be done upon us, when his own time comes; Since even the vileſt Laws of men have this obligation and validity upon the Conſciences of Subjects, to reſtrain all indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and diſturbances againſt them, and the Legiſlative. For if the Senate has not Authority to oblige us to evil, it has to modeſty, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from their Preſence, and Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>the Parliament thought their Authority alone ſufficient to deprive the Biſhops, and did not ask, nor think they wanted the concurrence of the Clergy to make their Act valid,</hi> very well; <hi>they</hi> did not think ſo. And if you confine this ſufficiency to a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Obligation on the Church to ſubmit, and concur, this opinion of the Parliament is very true, tho' I believe they ground it, not upon any
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102364:129"/>mere pretended Arbitrary Deſpotick Power, but upon the Weight and Sanctity of the Cauſes, on which they founded the Law. But if you think it the opinion of the Parliament, that their Acts can actually paſs into an Eccleſiaſtical Effect without Eccleſiaſtical Concurrence, you fix an opinion on them rather to be charged with Non-ſenſe than Falſhood. For if all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, and Chriſtian Laity with them will adhere to thoſe whom the Statute dooms to Deprivation, how can the Statute paſs into an Eccleſiaſtical Effect? And ſo the Church ought always to do if they ſhall apparently perſecute her Biſhops for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſake, to hinder their temporal Laws from attaining an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Effect againſt the innocent, whatſoever afflictions they may ſuffer for the oppoſition. And if ever Popery, Arianiſm, Socinianiſm, or Eraſtianiſm ſhould (which God forbid) preſs it ſelf upon us by Act of Parliament, I doubt not but our Church alſo will herein become Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant againſt ſuch Laws, and ſeal their Integrity with their Blood. So that in our Caſe the only Queſtion herein is, whether this Law upon the Church to admit the Deprivation be unjuſt, or no? If it be in the Churches Judgment, ſhe ought to refuſe it; if not unjuſt, 'tis admiſſible. Now this we believe, and you the contrary, and God muſt judge between us; but in the mean time the church muſt act according to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Convictions.</p>

                        <p>But the form of the Statute is, that the Recuſants ſhall be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Deprived, which muſt import the actual Deprivation to be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted purely by the mere virtue of this Act ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to the Concurrence of the Church.</p>

                        <p>I would willingly allow you, that this is the Senſe of the Parliament, if you can clear it from Non-ſenſe, of which I am not willing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102364:130"/>that great Aſſembly ſhould be impeached. And I will alſo grant you, that the mere Virtue of the Statute alone can deprive them of their Temporalities without the Churches Concurrence. But perhaps all Decrees of Humane Power, in things dubious, and future, have this tacit, yet neceſſary Suppoſition, <hi>quantum in nobis eſt,</hi> as much as in them lies; for farther certainly no Power can go. And further as to the Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 'tis poſſible the Parliament might intend no more than this, that the Recuſants ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, or quitted by the Church upon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted preſumption of her ſubmiſſive Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or the Recuſants own Ceſſion, when the Temporalities were gone, and their Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſuch neceſſary, and valid Laws. But the Senſes of Statutes I leave to the Parliament, and the Judges, while yet you and I know our Eccleſiaſtical Principles and Obligations in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters truly Spiritual and Chriſtian, and muſt act accordingly, whatſoever Lay-men or Lawyers think hereupon. And agreeably the Dean and Chapter of the Metropolitical Church, looking upon the Sees of the Recuſant Biſhops <hi>de jure</hi> vacant, diſcharged the Recuſants of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by taking the Juriſdiction to themſelves, which in ſuch Caſes they judged lawful by the Laws of God, as well as Man, as alſo Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal according to our Conſtitutions; tho' herein they aſſume no ordinary, or proper form of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over Biſhops not fallen <hi>de jure</hi> from their Sees; and you may very well remember, that I noted againſt this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Objection in our laſt Conference,<note n="†" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. pag. 29.</note> 
                           <hi>that this was, and might be done upon judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conſcience for themſelves, and the Church, but not of ordinary Juriſdiction over the Biſhop.</hi> And therefore you ought not to have charged this
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102364:130"/>upon us, as if we herein own ſuch a Juriſdiction, which we diſclaim, but have proved, that the Church may not upon juſt and neceſſary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes deſert her Biſhop, over whom otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſhe confeſſedly has no proper, formal or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Juriſdiction. It is moſt evidently plain, that, if the Cauſes be juſt, our Canonical and Legal Conſtitutions not only allow, but require ſuch a Divorce from the fallen Biſhop, and aſſign the Juriſdiction to the Church Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical. Now if this our Conſtitution be irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and invalid, why did the Deprived ever, own it, till now the operation of it came upon them? And therefore, whether this imports ſuch a formal Juriſdiction, or no, (which yet I deny) it cannot be reproached for Uncanonical without condemning our firſt Reformation, and thoſe Models to which your ſelves have hitherto ſworn Canonical obſervance.</p>

                        <p>Except I much forget my ſelf, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſerted any number of inferiour Clergy-men to be Repreſentatives to the whole Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> nor yet that the Biſhops were deprived by the Repreſentative Body of the whole Church; but this I ſay, that the actual Eccleſiaſtical eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is performed ſucceſſively by ſeveral Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative parts of the whole Church, as firſt by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102364:131"/>the Metropolitical Church, and then the Dioceſan Chapters repreſenting their reſpective Province, and Dioceſes. Now upon an Act for Deprivation, the See upon juſt cauſes becoming <hi>de jure</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, the Courſe of our Eccleſiaſtical Politie is ſuch; The Metropolitical Church firſt takes and deputes the juriſdiction, the Dioceſan Chapters omit their acknowledgments of their former Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and at length upon precept proceed to a new Election, Biſhops upon this (except in mere Tranſlations) conſecrate the Elected, thence the whole Epiſcopal Colledge own the new, as do the Cathedral Clergy in their offices, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all the Clergy in perſon, and the Laity by their repreſentative Churchwardens in admitting the Viſitations of the new Prelates, and executing their precepts Eccleſiaſtical, and all Lay-men perſonally own them, that recieve their Confirmations, Benedictions, or any other Sacred Ordinances from them, or with them as Biſhops. All which, being uniformly and peaceably promoted by theſe gradations, if of much more Weight and Efficacie than a mere Synodical Cenſure, before it has attained to ſuch an actual conſequent Reception in the whole Church. And therefore, when this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is complete, we may truly ſay, the Biſhops are Eccleſiaſtically outed, not by the Church repreſentative, but by the Church original. And hence ſuch a plenary conſent of the Church diffuſive againſt a few Biſhops and Clergy, on the account of their Recuſancy, muſt in legal and equitable conſtruction be preſumed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a common uniform Senſe of their notorious incapacity and ineptitude, of guiding Conſciences, and exerciſing Epiſcopal Functions and Authorities under the preſent State. And upon notorious incapacities the Church may alienate her ſelf from the incapacitated, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102364:131"/>recurr to other Biſhops for new Conſecrations or Inveſtitures, eſpecially when juſtly required thereto by the offended Powers. And if any incapacity of exerciſing the Pontifical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> eſpecially from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning the Principality of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which is, or comes very near your Caſe) and <hi>Korah</hi> had oppoſed him purely on that account, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction had never been recorded to his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but his praiſe for ever. But as to your idle Queſtion about complying with Uſurpers, (which, like <hi>Altar againſt Altar,</hi> is the <hi>Incipe Maenalios</hi> of your whole Ditty) as it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived full anſwers already, ſo here 'tis nothing to our preſent purpoſe, ſince our diſcourſe now is founded on a Suppoſition of a due and full Settlement of Legal Powers in the State, which ought not to be charged with formal Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Their Silence in that Caſe was an yielding up and betraying their Right, as it is if a Peer does not proteſt againſt any vote that paſſes, his conſent to it is implyed.

But ſince it is now my turn to break Silence, I will ſpeak to this point but this once, and, if you will not, I will for ever hereafter hold my peace. Firſt, then I muſt it ſeems talk of Silence, of which I am taxed, as if I had aſcribed to it, not only Conſent, but Authority too, and actual Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which are two points beyond the lines of the Proverb. Conſider we then at firſt the proverbial Importance here in the Carriage of the Convocation. We were<note n="*" place="margin">Sol &amp; Ab. pag. <hi>28.</hi>
                           </note> enquiring into the Senſe of the Churches in common, which you excepting againſt challenged a Senſe of our Convocations; and I tell you, <hi>That their Silence under the Statute of Deprivation argues their opinion to be, that they were in this to yield
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102364:133"/>to the State.</hi> But I, well obſerving, that bare Silence is Non-action, and mere nothing, and in it ſelf ſimply of no determinate ſignification, ſet ſuch other poſitive Acts, in<note n="†" place="margin">Grot. de Jure, &amp;c. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> Parag. <hi>5.</hi>
                           </note> conjunction with which this Non-action, or Silence might legally and morally be interpreted to a conſent of yielding herein to the State. To this purpoſe I premiſed <hi>the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conformity of moſt Biſhops, and Clergy, and Laity, that our ſending a Convocation at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Precept ſhows, that we own Subjection to them;</hi> and condemns the Recuſancy as an [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitating] Error (for ſo I meant by ſofter forms of expreſſion, that I might not gaul you) and ſo I conjoyn the Silence of the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thoſe other poſitive indications, that it might joyntly ground a legal Argument, that in their Judgment they ought to yield to the State. So that you had united Circumſtances enough to have fore-ſtrangled your Cavils, if your prejudice had not blinded you. On the Seſſion of the ſecond Convocation the Recuſants were in a State of actual Suſpenſion, and the Day of Deprivation drew on. Now this the Convocation in their Judgment were to yield to, or oppoſe, for 'tis impoſſible but they muſt judge one, or the other to be their Duty. Now if they had been of opinion for the oppoſition, this muſt have been done by Synodical Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance; if their Judgments was for the Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then they were to break no Silence to the contrary. Now then is not their actual Silence hereupon a legal token that they thought it their Duty to yield in Silence? Except we will perverſly judge them ſilent againſt the Dictates of their Conſcience, which if you will, it will lye upon you to prove it out. Whenſoever things are brought into ſuch a Strait, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102364:133"/>Silence, or Contradiction muſt become a Duty, there Silence is as moral a Token of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as Contradiction is of Diſſent. And in all caſes where either Aſſent, or Diſſent is inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requiſite, and the Rule is, that all Diſſents muſt be expreſs and proteſted, as the forms are in the <hi>Lord's Houſe,</hi> and proceſs of Actions in the Civil Law, there Silence in Law is taken for Conſent. But here is yet more; the King had graciouſly conceded a liberty to the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to propoſe their Grievances in order to his Royal Redreſs; So that tho' they had no Civil or Legal Liberty to remonſtrate againſt the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, yet they had an opportunity to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented an humble Supplication for a relaxing Expedient, or a Temperament, on juſt Security for the inoffenſiveneſs of the ſuſpended. Yet neither did they think themſelves obliged in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo much as to break Silence in this manner herein; And muſt not the State then conclude, that the Church by this Silence thought it fit to yield? However I hope you do not think in good ſadneſs, that their Silence did ſignifie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, ſcorn, ſullenneſs, or denial to the State. For 'tis true in caſes of requeſt and contract Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is no grant of a Propoſal, but Silence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law, together with a conſequent Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Precept thereof, is an indubitable Token of Conſent, which was the Churches caſe here, while ſilent in her Convocation, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in her Metropolitical and Dioceſan Bodies. So much then for Conſent; next for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which you ſay is not aſſerted, but betrayed by this Silence. But neither here can I agree with you: For as I never ſaid, that Silence aſſerts Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo neither does it betray it. For your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Peers does not import a Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, but only a Vote conſented to by Silence, and this confirms my Obſervation, and refutes
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102364:134"/>you; For as the Silence of a Peer ſurrenders not his Peerage, ſo neither does ſuch Silence in the Church forfeit; or vacate her Authority; No, tho' the Church had had Right to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Parliament Houſe with Votes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations. But ſuppoſe it for once, that the Churches Silence had betrayed her Right, ſee upon whom the Treachery muſt be moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately charged. Did the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his other Recuſant Colleagues, that had a legal Right of Seſſion in the Lord's Houſe, enter, and enter a Proteſtation againſt the Validity of that Act, as wanting their, and the Churches Suffrage, or Synodical Concurrence? No, not a jot of this. And yet they, by their Station as well as Cauſe, ought to have been the firſt in the Proteſtation; which if they would not make for themſelevs, and the Churches Rights, then according to you they are Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and ſo 'tis unreaſonable in them, or you, to require the Proteſtation of others, leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, or obliged by their Order, Cauſe, and Principles. But the truth is, we had no juſt Cauſe, or legal Authority of making ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant Proteſtations, and ſo our Silence is not perfidious, but dutiful. Now this being ſo clearly ſtated, all your childiſh trifling upon French Subjects, and Turkey Mutes is very idle, and impertinent, ſince Silence does not indeed import Authority againſt, but Submiſſion under Laws. Yet even in theſe <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> oppreſſions the Silence argues an opinion, that they, either in Duty, or Prudence, are to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and quietly ſubmiſſive. And this certainly was the Senſe of our Saviour in his Silence, when he was led as a Lamb to the Slaughter. But to deal plainly, theſe Inſtances pertain not to our preſent Caſe; for here ours was Silence, and obedient Submiſſion to the Commands of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102364:134"/>State, the comporting with which in Silence is a Conſent to, and Comprobation of its Juſtice, and is more than a meer ſilent Patience under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Oppreſſions. So inartificial and improper is the Objection from theſe poor Mutes, and Vaſſals. Thirdly, you aſſure me, that Silence is no Deprivation. No verily; nor did I ever hear that it was. But, to intercept your haſt, whoſe Silence was I ſpeaking of? And to whom did I aſcribe the Eccleſiaſtical Acts of Deprivation? Why truly, I ſpake of the Silence in Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as importing their Opinion, that they ought not to oppoſe the Laws of the State. But I never ſaid, that the Convocation did deprive the Deprived. No ſurely; they ſate not at the time, or on the Day of Deprivation. But I told you before, that the Eccleſiaſtical and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Acts of Deprivation conſiſted in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical and Dioceſan Alienations, effected not by mere Silence, but Canonical Acts, and forms of procedure. And now let us ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Memory hath failed me any more than my Cauſe. I here aſſert the Silence of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, but afterward told you,<note n="*" place="margin">Sol. &amp; Ab. Pag. 34.</note> that a Motion for a Petition was ſtifled in the Lower Houſe of Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note n="†" place="margin">T. B. <hi>Repeats it thus,</hi> You tell us of a Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the lower Houſe of Convocation; <hi>but leaves out the word [Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled] fraudulently.</hi>
                           </note> tho' you clip my words on purpoſe to abuſe me. For a Motion may be ſtifled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is offered, by one, that knows, that it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be made. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an actual Motion of one Member may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the Silence of the whole Body. For if the Majority Vote Silence againſt the Motion for a Petition, the Convocation is ſilent, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all its Members, as to the Petition it ſelf, tho' ſome brake Silence in the ſilenced Motion,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102364:135"/>but keep it after, thro' voluntary deſiſtence, or Canonical Order. Now here in fact a Motion was offered by one excellent Perſon, but, upon the report then tendred to him of my Lord Archbiſhop <hi>Sancroft</hi>'s requeſt to the contrary, he deſiſted in Silence, tho' you however in this Conference have thus barbarouſly beſpatter'd him, when there was juſt reaſon for your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But however herein you own <hi>T. B.</hi> has a very contracted Memory too, when<note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>T. B.</hi> See Lett. Pag. <hi>42.</hi>
                           </note> he endeavours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the Story of this Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo ſtifled on the ſaid Report. But you have one Argument, that will confound me into Eternal Silence or Amazement, namely, that they that refuſed Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor, would not have conſented to have had him their Archbiſhop. Well; be it ſo; what then? Perhaps, if the Election of Biſhops had been freely left to our Convocations, they would have admitted few, or none of thoſe, whom our Kings have advanced, but yet the Chapters ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting have conſented to the Legality of thoſe Nominations, which they have not always judged ſo expedient, and the Epiſcopal Colledge have conſented to their Communion, with the reſt of the Clergy, as well in, as out of Convocation, as no doubt they will with the new Archbiſhop at their next meeting, without breaking any Silence againſt him by way of Diſſent. And now at laſt I am come to your Queſtions about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Epiſcopacy. And firſt you ſay, the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> are ſilent under the Abolition of Epiſcopacy it ſelf, and twit me that hereby belike they concur to that Act of Abolition. No; Brother, this does not follow from me, but according to you their Silence is a betraying their Right. But here again, you cannot diſtinguiſh the Caſe of quitting a Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102364:135"/>Right to an Authority, which is our Caſe, from the Abolition of the Authority it ſelf Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, which is the Caſe of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For they that can legally do the former, may not legally do the latter. For the King can depoſe the Judges, but not the Courts, and diſmiſs other Officers, whoſe Offices he cannot abrogate. And the Church can depoſe Prieſts, and Biſhops, but not the Prieſthood, or Epiſcopacy. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Civil State has more intrinſick Power in the Spirituals of the Church, than the Church her ſelf ever had in moſt perfect Freedom, judge you. But here I muſt Advocate for the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt your Calumnies; For tho' they made no formal Proteſtation at Parliament, yet they aſſert their Epiſcopacy by an avowed Communion of their own, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Presbyterian Model. But as to the Civil Power of abrogating Epiſcopacy here, I anſwer, 'tis as great as 'tis any where; but I find not our Parliaments to pretend to the ſame Opinions here as they do in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and I hope you will not require me to juſtifie Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Pretenſions. I think the Conſtitutions of our Orders are founded on Divine Rules, and have deſcended to us by Traditions truly Catholic and Primitive, which here we are not ſo rude to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, or violate by any wanton Claims of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power; and in my Opinion the <hi>Scots</hi> will never acquit themſelves well to God, his Church, and the King, till they copy after us, where E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy is as well ſecured as the Scriptures, and Sacraments, and all the moſt eſſential Parts of Chriſtianity. But if any of theſe ever happen to be perſecuted here, I hope we ſhall remember Him, who on all ſuch Occaſions requires us to take up the Croſs, and follow him. And now we are upon this melancholy Speculation of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I fear the Preſages you have
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102364:136"/>made from their fall, have been moſt influential with you to your preſent Recuſancy to thoſe Powers, from whom you expect our Diſſolution. This, I confeſs, is a very deplorable jealouſie, for which if there had been ſufficient ground, (as there was not) yet this will not juſtifie Recuſancy to the Civil Powers. But the miſchief of it is more than Perſonal, and Temporary, For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Deprived Fathers, who by their glorious merits in the laſt Reign, might have been uſeful Mediators for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church, and Promoters of our own, are now become uncapable of this ſecond Glory, and uſeleſs to the Churches happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by this unfortunate Recuſancy. But herein I charge no man's Conſcience, but only bewail the infelicity. And ſhall pray, that the Goodneſs of God will ſo graciouſly diſpoſe our Tempers, and Affairs, as in his own good time to ſet all things at Right, and ſhew us at length the Light of his countenance.</p>

                        <p>Indeed it was almoſt lapſed, but now upon your Suggeſtion I have recovered it, and will accordingly lay it before you. <hi>As to this Caſe of the</hi> Marian <hi>Biſhops, ſaith he, or of other Popiſh Biſhops ander</hi> Edward <hi>the Sixth, two things are to be noted in their removal and ejection out of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick's. One is from the Temporalities, the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and Preferments thereof; and theſe Temporal Endowments are directly ſubjects to the Temporal Power,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The other is from the Spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence and dependence of the People on them as on heads of Church unity and Communion for religious miniſtrations. And this there was no need to deprive the Popiſh Biſhops of, for they had already deprived themſelves of it by their own Corruptions, both in Doctrines, and Devotions. Adulterations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and corrupt miniſtrations of the word, of Prayers, and Sacraments, break the Ligaments, which tye on People to this adherence to any Biſhops, or Paſtors, yea, tho' they were Apoſtles themſelves.</hi> Tho' we, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be anathema, or accurſed, <hi>ſaith St.</hi> Paul Gal. 1.8. — <hi>When therefore any Biſhops, and Paſtors, inſtead of heading Chriſtian Truth, appear at the head of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Chriſtian Errors, the people are diſcharged from their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and Dependence upon them, and are to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102364:137"/>unite themſelves as they can to others, who ſtill keep firm to that neceſſary Truth, and Goſpel Worſhip, which they have forſaken. And this was done by the Popiſh Biſhops, who fed the people with falſe Doctrines, and polluted Prayers, and Miniſtrations, which left no need of any thing more to deprive them of the Peoples Communion, and Dependence, theſe Papal Corruptions of Religious Miniſtrations being enough to diſcharge, and drive them away of themſelves. So that the reformed Biſhops, when they were ſet at the heads of thoſe Dioceſes, called none away, nor made them break off from any juſt and due Spiritual Dependence on their former Biſhops, whoſe own heretical Doctrine, and corrupt Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had made the people ceaſe from depending any longer in Conſcience upon them. They wanted only to be Lawfully empowered, and regularly ordained themſelves by Epiſcopal Impoſition of hands, as all thoſe reformed Biſhops plainly were, — and ſo were no Spiritual Intruders, nor guilty of any Civil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, or Injuſtice. — But where Biſhops are Orthodox, and are deprived for their adherence to Truth and Righteouſneſs, both in their private Practice and Publick Miniſtrations, the people are ſtill left Spiritually to depend on them. — And ſo we our ſelves ſhould have thought, at leaſt we all ſeem, as if we ſhould, if by Gods Providence the Civil State had gone on to ddprive our reformed Biſhops for ſticking to the Doctrines and Worſhip of the Reformation, and had ſet up Popiſh Biſhops in their places,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vide.</hi>

                        <p>This Doctrine of that learned Perſon muſt be admitted with a grain of Salt, or elſe it will be very unwholeſom, and prove very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive in the Eccleſiaſtick Body. For tho every ſingle Chriſtian is to abhor, and defie all falſe Doctrine, condemned by the unanimous Senſe and ſuffrage of the Univerſal Church from Divine Authorities, yet ſingle Perſons cannot diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102364:137"/>and alone reject their Biſhops as not Biſhops for heretical Opinions, or corrupt Miniſtrations, which the general Body, and all Orders of the Church do not uniformly cenſure irregular, and renounce their Authors, except a juſt and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sentence paſs in form againſt them. When Churches are concorporated into Provincial and Dioceſan Unions, there muſt be ſome public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct for the diffuſive multitude, to a due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of Principles in order to ſuch Divorces. Thus of old, when grievances aroſe from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Biſhops, the people appealed to Synods to judge upon their Cauſe, but in Caſes noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious they addreſſed to other Churches, Biſhops, and Synods to allow their neceſſary Rejection of their irregular Biſhop, and ordain them others. And this uſage was as common as uſeful, till the Papal Uſurpations rendred it impracticable in the Weſtern Church, and ſo neceſſitated extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary forms of reformation. For here the Prince, and the People, and a great Body of the Clergy, having an Eccleſiaſtical Cauſe of Controverſie againſt the <hi>Marian</hi> Biſhops, unrelievable by any fair domeſtic, or foreign Synod, were forced, upon the Notoriety of the Evil, to uſe extraordinary meaſures of purgation, not by rabble, or inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Partitions, but by a National Judgment in Parliament, as a middle expedient, as well againſt inteſtine Schiſms, as Romiſh abuſes; upon which diſcharge of Papal Tyranny, a way was opened to that true and uniform Senſe of true Religion, which the whole emancipated Church preſently received with a glad and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Uniformity, which was a felicity however not atchievable by a looſe unorganized Multitude. Since then the whole People of this Land did in their National Senate Vindicate the pure Religion eſtabliſhed in former Convocations from the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Biſhops, the enacted Deprivation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102364:138"/>more againſt their Spiritual Conduct, than their Temporal fortunes, and the People followed that publick intention, not their own private counſel in the reception of new Biſhops, and the models of reformation. And herein ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of prudence were obſerved, which cannot be ſecured in a promiſcuous multitude, which I wonder that Author did not conſider. For a Prieſt is not immediatly upon dropping of an Error ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially heretical to be taken by all at random for a formal and ſelf-deprived heretic, or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> but he muſt be previouſly heard, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, and only upon incorrigible Obſtinacy to be rejected, with appeal unto God, and an apology to all Churches, or Spiritual Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, and untainted. But then this is a Canonical form of exauctoration by the Church, not a formal Self-deprivation, otherwiſe upon this Authors Principle, all the Hierarchy of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Communion was long ſelf-deprived before the Reformation, and totally exauctorated, and how then will he juſtify our Epiſcopal Succeſſion? For ſuch <hi>ipſo facto</hi> irregularities, that are ſo in their own nature, and not by mere Canonical Ordinance, degrade as well as deprive, from not only Order, but Communion, to which of old upon Penitence they were wont to be reſtored, not as Prieſts, but as Laymen, for that ſuch a fall was an <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Degradation of Order, in which there were to be no public Penitents. But now, if we make ſuch Deprivation the Act of the Chriſtian People, as we muſt, then it, and all the previous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs thereunto muſt be executed by ſome formed Seſſion, or Council for the Place and People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; but for the whole People of this Land we have no Council but that of Parliament. And here it muſt be noted, that a Chriſtian Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath as much Spiritual Right againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Prieſts as the common Chriſtian Multitude,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102364:138"/>and if the Multitude may on ſuch notorious Corruptions eject one, and procure another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, even without the Conſent of civil Powers, according to this Authors Doctrine, ſurely ſuch Right much more belongs to the Chriſtian Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative, to which the Care of Religion does by Divine Ordinances belong, as well as to the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, and common Multitude, which had a real need of their Counſel and Conduct in ſo great a Difficulty. The People therefore in Parliament did their Part in the Ejection of the <hi>Marian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all the Chapters, and other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Orders ſequaciouſly concurred, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the Deſign of that Act in their Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the condemned Recuſants. And tho' all this was done for refuſing the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; yet that Recuſancy being grounded on falſe Principles in Religion, and maintained in Defence of the Romiſh Uſurpations and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Statute of Deprivation had not only a civil Intention, but Religious alſo, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived accordingly. But all this while I find no Anſwer to that famous Paſſage quoted by me<note n="†" place="margin">Sol. and Ab. Pag. 32.</note> out of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Tract of Schiſm, tho' of ſo great Moment, and of ſo great Strength to juſtifie ſuch Statutes of Deprivation for the Security of the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt Seducements and Seditions. But if you would take my Counſel, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you not to lay the Cauſe of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in Points of Religion, nor make common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Judges of them, for fear of a Snap, that perhaps you are not aware of.</p>

                        <p>Well, let our Cauſe be what it will in Fact, or Opinion, I look upon theſe Lay and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Forms of Deprivation, to be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Spiritual Franchiſes of the Church, tho' we ſuppoſe, that ſuch ſervile and gradual Concurrences of the Church do give them an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Effect; for that they deſtroy out of the Faith of Chriſtians the Senſe of thoſe Spiritual Liberties and Authorities of the Church, that by a Divine Charter, and an Apoſtolic Deſcent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to her; and inſtil a fatal Eraſtianiſm into men's Principles, and for that Cauſe ought not to be received, but cenſured by the Church; for that your Party founds their Authority on this
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102364:141"/>falſe Propoſition, that the Church and State of <hi>England</hi> are the ſame Society, whereas there are many Subjects of the State, that are no Members of the Church, as Apoſtates, Papiſts, Heretics, and all unbaptized Perſons. Tho' yet were this Hypotheſis true, that all the ſame perſons were equally Members of the Church and State, yet as they are a Church, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſociated, they muſt be governed by a Spiritual Authority, and as a State, by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power of the Sword; nor muſt the identity of the People confound the Diſtinction of Powers. Beſides, as we are a Church, we are of Right ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated into the unity of the whole Catholic Church, to be maintained by an uniform Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Conduct, the only ligament of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Communion; but as we are a State, the Catholic Church is not concerned with us, to take any Cogniſance of our Civil Procedures, but if as a Church we corrupt the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government into Civil, we break off, and excommunicate our ſelves from the Catholic Unity by deſerting the Catholic Forms and Ties of Union.</p>

                        <p>As to that Principle of the Identity of Church and State, and the Conſequences Men draw from thence to aſſert the Right of Civil Authority in Spiritual Proceſſes, I leave it to them, whoſe Heads are clear enough to juſtifie it. But, for my own part allowing your excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary, yet our Caſe has juſtified it ſelf <hi>ex naturâ Rei.</hi> And I muſt further adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you, that this Church has long ſubmitted to the uſe of ſuch Powers over us, and that fundamentally in Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reformation, and in many other matters in which the State had not ſo much pretence of Right, or Neceſſity, all which have paſſed uncenſured by us, but in this, whether well, or ill, God muſt judge.

In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. they ſtruck out the Ordinaries names out of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes Eccleſiaſtical, and ſet in the Kings, as if all Church Power had been derived from the Crown; the non-payment of Tenths, tho' omitted by mere neglect, and not on any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Opinion, remains yet a Cauſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation. And thoſe ſhackles, which the State of old thought neceſſary to reſtrain us from Popery, now the reaſons of that Conduct are ceſſant, become great Obſtacles to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Catholic Reformation of our yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining defects, of which th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Yet all this Subjection we have born in Silence, tho' hereby only can Popery be reduced, whenſoever a Popiſh Conjuncture ſhall ariſe upon us; and no Body has yet dared to offer a good mediation with the Public for a Temperament in theſe things. And if our dulneſs herein has not been by us, or you accounted Schiſmatical, ſhall we be judged Schiſmatics in admitting theſe much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Deprivations, in which the Lay-powers are concerned not only in point of Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but even in certain and undubitable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Right?</p>

                           </note> juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge to the innocent, a primitive, fundamental, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Right to good, as well in common, as in conſecrated Places, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that in order to this Claim they muſt give all juſt ſecurity and aſſurance of their innocency, upon Teſt demanded by the Civil Powers, that are Guardians of theſe fundamental Liberties to all good Subjects; of which innocency an Oath of Allegiance ſeems the moſt obvious, proper, and uſual Form of ſecurity between Subjects and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns. Otherwiſe the Civil Powers may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain thoſe Libeties, of which they are the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees. Thus a Civil Soveraign may prohibit, and puniſh all converſation with the Enemies, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants of his Civil Authority. Now converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſimply in it ſelf alone is a ſecular communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but abſolutely Fundamental to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, which is a viſible Communion in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals. Though then the Secular Authority alone, as ſuch, does not touch the Spirituals, yet it may upon juſt and legal Cauſes take away all that ſecular and local Communion, that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the Eccleſiaſtical. And he that may upon Recuſancies of Subjection forbid all perſonal Communication with a Recuſant, may forbid it in any certain Place, Time, Matter, or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and conſequently at all ſuch Times, and Places, when, and where the Recuſant may call upon him to attend in Spirituals. But this Right, and Authority of the Magiſtrate I lodge not in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will reſpectively, but on the nature and merit of the provocation. And the Right, which the Chriſtians have to the Liberty of their Sacred
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102364:142"/>Functions, is not peculiar to them as Chriſtians, by a Charter altogether unconditionally exempt from Civil Powers, and ſo a Right of Gods poſitive conſtitution in the Church, as a Society founded by Chriſt, liable to no ſecular Reflections for any Cauſe whatſoever; but is a common, and natural Right to all Perſons of clear and unſpotted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as ſuch, to do that which is good, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally due to them from the Creation. And hence Civil Powers, becoming Judges of our Morals and Innocency, are Guardians of that natural Right, but may juſtly deny it to others, but will not approve their innocency by due Teſts to the Public Peace of the Government, to which Recuſants therefore the rightful Capacity Eccleſiaſtical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is loſt, when the natural Right to Society is, either totally, or in the proper opportunities of ſacred Communion, juſtly denied by the Civil Powers. And to ſay true, he that by ill Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or Practices deſerves the loſs, and deprivation of all common Society, much more deſerves the deprivation of the Spiritual, that ſtands as a Super-ſtructure on the other. And therefore if our ill merits Authorize the Powers to take away at the bottom the Foundation of our Religious Commuion, they can, tho' not directly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly touch, yet undermine the ſpiritual Structure, by deſtroying its ſecular Foundation, which lies within the Authority and Care of Civil Powers. So that in this reſpect and form an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Prince may rightly deprive ſeditious, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal Prieſts of the Priviledge of actually uſing their Eccleſiaſtical Functions, by rightly denying them ſo much ſecular Society, as is Fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite to the exerciſe of them. And thus far a Statute of Deprivation may have this Civil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, that no Subject ſhall yield corporal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Recuſant Prieſts, when they call him to ſacred Offices any where, and Laws may ſhut
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102364:143"/>them out from conſecrated Places, that there may be no ſuch local Society in them. And if ſuch Recuſancy againſt civil Powers be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, confeſſed, or avowed, then is ſuch Act of State both juſt, and civil only, but at the ſame time, the bottom of the Recuſants Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Offices is righteouſly, and validly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

                        <p>Well, well, notwithſtanding theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, yet the Temporal Powers cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the actual Relation between Prieſt and People, tho' they may ſuſpend, or incapacitate them hereby from the actual Miniſteries of their Orders; And ſo hence accrues no Right to civil Powers to impoſe new Biſhops on the Church.</p>

                        <p>There are two known Canonical Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of depriving Spiritual Perſons, Immoralities, and erroneous Principles. So that; if either of theſe hath merited, and drawn after it a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Deprivation of all that ſecular, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Communion, and Society, which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſacred Functions, the Church upon certain Notoriety of that Guilt, Forfeiture, and civil Incapacity, may elect, and conſecrate others, who have contracted no ſuch Blemiſh, or Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Nor needs there here the Judgment of a Synod, (as is confeſſed in the like Caſe of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linicus</hi> and, <hi>Cyrus</hi> before mentioned) which is only neceſſary to diſcuſs and determine things dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Fact, or Right. So that in ſuch Caſes, where there is no Rule ſet to the contrary, the Church on her old original Liberties may of her own accord proceed to a new Promotion, and I think ought to do ſo, when the Blemiſh, and conſequent Incapacity are irremediable. And what the Church in freedom may do without Command, ſhe may do when commanded, even by thoſe Powers, which have no direct Right to manage our Eccleſiaſticals, as Infidel, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102364:143"/>Un-Chriſtian Powers have not. Yet indirectly, I grant, a new Settlement in the Church may be neceſſary to the weal of an Un-Chriſtian State, which then has an indirect Right to command the Church within it to fill the Vacancies, and then ſhe is in Duty bound to obey, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſo commanded, as having no Authority to oppoſe thoſe actual Reaſons, or the civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſuch the ſecular Commands, ſo that in the lawful Vacancy ſhe muſt be obedient. And if this be a juſt Rule for the Chriſtian Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Un-Chriſtian Princes, much more ought it to be ſo under Chriſtian ones, to whom, as nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers, you know our Church gives great Homage, and Deference. Have you any thing more to object?</p>

                        <p>T. B. is one of thoſe Men, who love to ſpeak evil of Dignities, and the things they know not, ſupplying the Narrowneſs of his Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Rage and Bitterneſs, for which I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily remit him to God's Mercy.</p>
                        <p>But as for your Fathers, and all the venerable Numbers of good Men fallen in this Change, I compaſſionately beſeech them tenderly to lay theſe things to heart, and unanimouſly to think of ſome healing Expedient for our mutual Peace, and Joy. There have been, who, upon the bare dry
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102364:144"/>Inferences of their Arguments, have deſired them to deſiſt, and quit claim only, which is to ask, not ſhew them Charity. But might it not be thought too aſſuming, I think, I could propoſe ſuch a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Scheme of Reſolutions, as would ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cloſe up our preſent Wounds, as to turn all our Sighs and Sorrows into Joys, and the Voice of Melody. But being conſcious of my Station, and Meaſures, and doubtful of your Miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, I forbear, and leave you, and your Counſels to the Divine Conduct, and your own Piety, that you may happily recover that Union, from which your Errors and Infirmities have too much alienated you, being willing to hope, that (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of <hi>Oneſimus</hi>) <hi>Perhaps you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from us for a Seaſon, that we ſhould receive you again for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
